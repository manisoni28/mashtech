Who do you think had.put it in there?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answers:</strong><br />\n1. The author found a roll-top desk for sale in a junk shop. It was made of oak wood, but it was in a veiy bad condition.<br />\n2. In the secret drawer of the desk, the author found a small tin box. It had a letter in it. I think the owner of the roll-top desk might have put it there.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Comprehension Check &nbsp;(Page 14)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Who had written the letter, to whom, and when?</strong><br />\n<strong>2. Why was the letter written &mdash; what was the wonderful thing that had happened?</strong><br />\n<strong>3. What jobs did Hans Wolf and Jim Macpherson have when they were not soldiers?</strong><br />\n<strong>4. Had Hans Wolf ever been to Dorset? Why did he say he knew it?</strong><br />\n<strong>5. Do you think Jim Macpherson came back from the war? How do you know this?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answers:</strong><br />\n1. John Macpherson, a captain in the British army, had written that letter, dated Dec. 26, 1914, to his wife Connie.<br />\n2. The letter described a wonderful event. The two armies-the British and the Ger&shy;man&mdash;fighting against each other celebrated Christmas together.<br />\n3. Before joining the army, Hans played the cello in the orchestra and Jim was a teacher.<br />\n4. No, Hans had never been to Dorset. He had only read about Dorset in Hardy&rsquo;s novel &lsquo;Far from the Madding Crowd&rsquo;.<br />\n5. No, Jim Macpherson never came back home from the war. Perhaps therefore his wife Connie had preserved his letters.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Comprehension Check &nbsp;(Page 15)</strong><br />\n1. Why did the author go to Bridport?<br />\n2. How old was Mrs Macpherson now? Where was she?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Answers:</strong><br />\n1. The author went to Bridport to meet Mrs Jim Macpherson and deliver to her Jim&rsquo;s letter.<br />\n2. Macpherson was 101 years old. She was in a nursing home.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Comprehension Check &nbsp;(Page 16)</strong><br />\n1. Who did Connie Macpherson think her visitor was?<br />\n2. Which sentence in the text shows that the visitor did not try to hide his identity?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Answers</strong><br />\n1. Connie thought that the visitor was her own husband, Jim Macpherson.<br />\n2. That sentence is, &ldquo;you&nbsp;&nbsp;told me you&rsquo;d come home by Christmas, dearest,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;And here you are, the best Christmas present in the world. Come closer, Jim dear, sit down.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Working with the Text &nbsp;(Page 16)</strong><br />\n<strong>1. For how long do you think Connie had kept Jim&rsquo;s letter? Give reasons for your answer.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Connie had kept Jim&rsquo;s last letter till January 25, 1915. The letter was dated Dec. 26, 1914.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Why do you think the desk had been sold, and when?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The desk must have been sold when Connie&rsquo;s house had burnt. The table had been damaged by fire as well as water.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Why do Jim and Hans think that games or sports are good ways of resolving conflicts? Do you agree?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Both Jim and Hans were soldiers. Both were warm hearted. They had seen the sufferings of war. So it was natural for them to hate war. They favoured a peaceful solution to settle disputes. Games or sports, they said, were good ways of resolving conflicts. I also quite agree with them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Do you think the soldiers of the two armies are like each other, or different from each other? Find evidence from the story to support your answer.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;All human beings are alike in many ways. They love peace and hate war. They want to live together. Examples from the story: &ldquo;Then they were calling out to us from a cross no man&rsquo;s land. &ldquo;Happy Christmas, Tommy! Happy Christmas! &ldquo;When we had got over the surprise some of us shouted back.&rdquo; Same to you, Fritz ! Same to you!&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Mention the various ways in which the British and the German soldiers become friends and find things in common at Christmas.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The British and the German soldiers belonged to different camps. They were enemies in war time. But after all they were human beings and therfore they had similar feelings. They shared the festive spirit of the Christmas. They got over hatred and played games, feasted and drank like good friends. Both hated war. Both were anxious to go back to their families at the end of war.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. What is Connie&rsquo;s Christmas present? Why is it the best Christmas present in the world?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Connie thought that Jim had come back home from war. She mistook the author for Jim. She had been waiting for her husband Jim. So the coming home of Jim was the best Christmas present in the world for her.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. Do you think&nbsp;the title of the story is suitable for it? Can you think of any other title(s)?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Decidedly the title of the story is most suitable. For the old Connie, no other present could have given her such joy as the coming home of Jim, her husband. Her presumption might be wrong, but she got the greatest happiness of her life. Since the story revolve* around Christmas, the alternate title of the story could be War and Peace&rsquo; or &lsquo;Christmas Gift&rsquo;. But neither can be a match to the present title.</p>\n",

Then present your arguments to the whole class.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;War means bloodshed, hate and destruction. It shows the animalism in man. Even the animals fight for some sound reason. But nations go to war to settle some petty dispute or in the name of religion. War solves no problem. Understanding alone can end differences. All religions condemn greed and bloody quarrels. Let us learn this great lesson from history.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. What kind of presents do you like and why? What are the things you keep in mind when you buy presents for others? Discuss with your partner. (For ex&shy;ample, you might buy a book because it can be read and re-read over a period of time.)</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Personally I am against the practice of exchanging expensive gifts. A rose or a token of affection suits every person and every pocket. This is why some guests offer bouquets or greeting cards alone. In case the gift is essential, it should satisfy some need and<sup>1</sup>&nbsp;have utility.

It has been ravaged by war. Buildings are in ruins and there is&nbsp;graveyard silence. My own house burnt when it was hit by a bombardment.

                "<p><strong>MORE QUESTIONS SOLVED</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>SHORT ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. What changes come to be seen in Ernest with passing of time?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Ernest was now a man of middle age. His hairs turned white and there were wrinkles across his forehead and furrows in his cheeks. He had become wiser with profound thoughts. The valley people respected him and took his advice on several occasions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Why did Ernest become sad after he examined the poet&rsquo;s features?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The poet had celebrated the Great Stone Face in one of his poems. When Ernest read that poem he became convinced that the poet had the likeness of the Great Stone Face. But when he met the poet, all his hopes shattered. He found no resemblance between the poet and the Stone Face. This was the reason why he became sad.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Why did the poet&rsquo;s eyes fill with tears?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The poet became sentimental to listen to Ernest. His words had power because they had depth. They were the words of life, a life of good deeds and selfless love. The poet felt that the life and character of Ernest were nobler strain of poetry that he had ever written. His eyes filled with tears and he said to himself that never was there so worthy a sage as that thoughtful face, with the glim of white hair diffused about it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Give a character-sketch of Ernest.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Ernest was a small boy when he became interested in the Great Stone Face. He felt that the face smiled on him. He wished to love the man with such a face. He was dutiful and helpful to his Mother. He grew up to be a gentle and quiet youth. He regarded the Stone Face as his teacher. He turned to the face for advice. He was not influnced by the common belief that Gathergold or Blood- and-Thunder General had any resemblance with the Stone Face. Even the poet&rsquo;s face made him sad. And he was right when the poet himself admitted that he wasn&rsquo;t worthy to be the likeness of the face. Finally, the same poet shouted with joy that Ernest himself was the likeness of the Stone Face.&nbsp;But Ernest remained humble to the last. He kept hoping that some wiser and better man than himself would appear.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. How did Ernest feel when people hailed him as the likeness of the Stone face?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Ernest was truly noble and humble. His deeds matched with his thoughts. He received the poet warmly. For a while he thought the writer of those poems was truly the greatest and wisest person. The poet and the people ultimately hailed him as the man with the likeness of the Stone Face. But Ernest did not agree with them. He kept hoping that a wiser and better man than himself would appear to make the prophecy true.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Describe in brief Ernest&rsquo;s reaction on three occasions when Gathergold, General Blood-and-Thunder and the poet came to the valley.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The inhabitants of the valley believed the story that one day a man bearing resemblance to the Stone Face would come there. The first one to arrive was a rich merchant Gathergold. The people were greatly excited. But Ernest noticed no resemblance between Gathergold&rsquo;s face and that of the Stone Face. Likewise he did not agree with the people who welcomed General Blood-and-Thunder as the greatest man. But Ernest almost believed that the poet was the person he had been waiting for. But again he was disappointed. In fact, Ernest himself was accepted as the Prophet.</p>\n"

                "<p><strong>Page No: 23</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Working with Poem</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. The cricket says, &quot;Oh! What will become of me?&quot; When does he say it, and why?<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nThe cricket said the given line when it found that its cupboard was empty and winter had arrived. It could not find a single crumb to eat on the snow covered ground and there were no flowers or leaves on the tree. It wondered what would become of it because it was getting cold and since there was nothing to eat, it would starve and die.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. (i) Find in the poem the lines that mean the same as &quot;Neither a borrower nor a lender be&quot; (Shakespeare).<br />\n(ii) What is you opinion of the ant&rsquo;s principles?<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\n(i) The lines in the poem that mean the same as &ldquo;Neither a borrower nor a lender be&rdquo; are &#39;But we ants never borrow; we ants never lend.&#39;</p>\n\n<p>(ii) I agree with what the ant says first that one should save something for the future so that he does not need to borrow or lend. But I don&rsquo;t agree with the ant&rsquo;s principle what he told later. If he says he is a friend of cricket then he should also help the cricket at the time of distress. On the other hand I believe that a friend in need is a friend indeed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. The ant tells the cricket to &quot;dance the winter away&quot;. Do you think the word &#39;dance&#39; is appropriate here? If so, why?<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nThe ant told the cricket to &ldquo;dance the winter away&rdquo; because when it asked the cricket what it did in the summers and why it had not stored any food for summers, the cricket answered that it sang through the warm and sunny months of summers. Therefore, in reply to this, the ant asked the cricket to &ldquo;dance&rdquo; the winter away just like it &ldquo;sang&rdquo; all through the summers and did not bother to store food for winters.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. (i) Which lines in the poem express the poet&#39;s comment? Read them aloud.<br />\n(ii) Write the comment in your own words.<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\n(i) The lines in the poem that express the poet&#39;s comment are &ldquo;Folks call this a fable. I&#39;ll warrant it true.&rdquo;</p>\n\n<p>(ii) This comment by the poet means that this poem is indeed a fable as it had a moral behind it. The cricket did not have anything to eat during the winters because it did not bother to store some food during summers. It was negligent and sang all through the summers. The ant, on the other hand, had built a nice home for itself and had stored food so that it would not starve during winters. It worked hard during summers to achieve this. Thus, the moral of the poem is to be prepared for the adverse times and always work hard instead of being negligent.</p>\n"

As a result of splitting the word into two and changing its spelling, &lsquo;roo&rsquo; rhymes with &lsquo;kangaroo&rsquo;.

Discuss with your partner the following definition of a poem.<br />\nA poem is made of words arranged in a beautiful order. These words, when read aloud with feeling, have a music and meaning of their own.<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nPoem is supposedly an artistic piece which contains a speech as well as a song, and is usually rhythmical and metaphorical. These beautiful arrangement of words beautify and add to the essence of the poem. Poems are supposedly read aloud to feel the intense passion and emotion with which they have been composed. The rhyming words in a poem puts various ideas and imaginations of the poet in sync. According to the Oxford Advanced Learner&#39;s Dictionary, a poem can be defined as a piece of writing in which the words are chosen for their sound and the images they suggest, not just for their obvious meanings. The words are arranged in separate lines, usually with a repeated rhythm, and often the lines rhyme at the end.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. &lsquo;The poetry of earth&rsquo; is not made of words. What is it made of, as suggested in the poem?<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\n&#39;The poetry of earth&#39; is not made of words, but of the song and the rhythm produced by grasshoppers and crickets in various seasons. The music of the nature never loses its charm even with changing seasons. Summer and winter are the toughest seasons of the year. In summer it is extremely hot and in winter it is very cold. So in these two seasons there are rare songs of joy and music on earth. But here the poet points to the poetry of earth during summer and winter. In summer, the grasshopper seems to be excitedly hopping around, tirelessly, while even in lonely and dark winter nights, one can identify the shrill voice with which the insect cricket sings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Find in the poem lines that match the following.<br />\n(i) The grasshopper&rsquo;s happiness never comes to an end.<br />\n(ii) The cricket&rsquo;s song has a warmth that never decreases.<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\n(i) In summer luxury &mdash; he has never done&nbsp;<br />\nWith his delights,<br />\n(ii) The cricket&rsquo;s song, in warmth increasing ever,</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. Which word in stanza 2 is opposite in meaning to &lsquo;the frost&rsquo;?<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nThe word &#39;frost&#39; in stanza 2 differs in meaning with the word &#39;grassy&#39;. Frost has a chilly reference which means a degree or state of coldness sufficient to cause the freezing of water. This meaning lacks a green live feeling which is present in the word &#39;grassy&#39;. Grassy means something which is like grass or pertains to grass.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. The poetry of earth continues round the year through a cycle of two seasons. Mention each with its representative voice.<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nThe poetry of earth continues round the years through the summer and the winter. In summer, the grasshopper&rsquo;s voice represents the poetry of the earth. While in winter the cricket&rsquo;s song represents the poetry of the earth.</p>\n"

But she alone survived. She was washed ashore by a wave. Almas climbed on to a log of wood. When she opened her eyes, she found herself in a hospital in Kamorta.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. What are the different ways in which Tilly&#39;s parents could have reacted to her behaviour? What would you have done if you were in their place?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Tilly foresaw the danger of tsunami at once. She became hysterial. Her parents didn&rsquo;t ignore her. They were sure that something wrong must be going to happen. So they all left the beach and were saved.

What are the two different ideas about why so few animals were killed in the tsunami? Which idea do you find more believable?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Very few animals were killed in the tsunami. Perhaps they feel the tremor much before humans do. Secondly, the animals have sixth sense. They can guess the coming disaster and so run away to safer places/higher ground.&nbsp;The idea that the animals are gifted with the sixth sense is more believable.

How did Tilly Smith save her family from the deadly waves?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Tilly Smith with her family was celebrating Christmas at a beach in Thailand. She was only 10 years old. She noted the sea water flowing towards, the beach. She was reminded of a geography lesson and the video of Hawaiian islands in 1946. She started shouting to her parents to clear off the beach. Her parents heeded her. They all took shelter in the third floor of the hotel and were saved.</p>\n\n<p><strong>II. LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Give a brief account of how the animate saved themselves when the giant waves hit India and Sri Lanka.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Before the great waves moved towards the coast in India and Sri Lanka, the wild and domestic animals foresaw the danger. Elephants ran for higher ground. Dogs refused to go outdoors. Zoo animals rushed into their shelters. This was perhaps the animals possess a sixth sense, which is very sharp and work as warning during disasters. So not many animals lost their lives in 2004 Tsunami while thousands people were washed away.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. What happened to Almas and her family?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>When the tremors came early in the morning, Almas and her family were sleep&shy;ing. Suddenly Almas&rsquo;s father saw the sea water recede. He understood that the water would come rushing back with great force. He woke everyone up and tried to rush them to a safer place. As they ran, her grandfather was hit on the head by something and fell down. Her father rushed to help him. But soon a giant wave came and swept both of them away. Her mother and ants too were washed away by the mighty waves. Almas was somehow saved. But she became the victim of trauma.</p>\n"

How did the British East India Company eventually become the ruler of India? What tactics did they adopt to expand their empire?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The British came to India as traders. Their chief motive was to make a fortune. But they needed political power to carry on their trade. They imposed heavy taxes on the peasants. The Indian goods lost their demand because the market was flooded with imported English goods. These goods didn&rsquo;t have to pay import duty. The British, in this way, ruined the skilled Indians. They dethroned the Indian rulers and took advantage of their rivalries. Slowly and steadily they spread their empire all over India.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. How did the white rulers cripple Indian industries?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The white rulers were chiefly traders. Their chief aim was to make profits at all cost. Hence, they began to ruin Indian industries. They imposed heavy taxes on farmers. They destroyed Indian cottage industries in order to sell goods manufactured in England. They exempted all goods imported from England from&nbsp;duties. In this way, their business flourished while the Indian industries died. The British made the Indians weak as well as poor.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. How did the resentment against the white man grow leading to armed revolt?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The white rulers adopted all the mean and foul tactics to take over the princely states. By 1856, they had conquered the whole of India. The Indian princes became their puppets. The British forced Indians to adopt Christian religion. They paid low wages to Indian soldiers. This created resentment among all sections of society, and the army as well. The so-called 1857 mutiny was, in fact, India&rsquo;s first War of Independence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4.

He also asked the people to throw out superstitions. He asked them to feel proud of their culture and learn English.

And then, when the summit is climSed, there is the exhilaration, the joy of having done something, the sense of a battle fought and won. There is a feeling of victory and of happiness.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. How does Ahluwalia explain the title of the lesson, &lsquo;The Summit Within&rsquo;?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The writer was a member of the team that reached the summit of Mount Everest. It was a great achievement. But he did not feel vain or heroic. He felt that his conquest of Everest was merely a physical experience. There was another summit within every person. It was his own mind. One has to climb it also to get fuller knowledge of oneself. This exercise is difficult. It also changes one as does standing on the summit of Mt. Everest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. How did Ahluwaliah feel standing on the summit?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Ahluwalia was overwhelmed by a deep sense of joy and thankfulness. Looking round from the summit, Ahluwalia told himself that his adventure, though risky, was worthwhile. The surrounding peaks looked like a jewelled necklace. It was an ennobling and enriching experience. He was filled with humility. He thanked God and then left on Everest a picture of Guru Nanak.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. How does Ahluwalia describe his achievement?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Ahluwalia feels that Everest is not just a physical climb. Standing on the mountain&rsquo;s top he felt how small he was in the big universe. He experienced a sense of fulfilment. It satisfied his love for adventure. The experience was not just physical, but also emotional and spiritual.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. What problems do the climbers face as they climb a mountain?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Breathing at great height is difficult. The climber has to cut the steps in the hard ice and he has to strain every nerve as he takes every step. Sometimes he curses himself for undertaking such a task. There are moments when he feels like going back for relief. But there is something that does not let him give up the struggle.</p>\n"

                "<p><strong>Speaking &nbsp;(Page 96)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Do you think it is right to kill an animal to save a human life? Give reasons for your answer.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer: &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ^<br />\nMost of the animals are our friends. Dogs, horses, elephants, cows are a few such animals that serve us. But man has been killing codfish or the whales for oil. Tigers are killed for their skin and bones. This is not fair. But there is no harm if any of them are killed strictly to save human life, properly and agriculture.<br />\nHowever, killing animals is a crime. It is wrong to kill wild life for their hide or for pleasure.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Imagine you wake up one morning and find a tiny animal on your doorstep. You want to keep it as a pet but your parents are not too happy about it. How would you persuade them to let you keep it? Discuss it in groups and present your argu&shy;ments to the class.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong><br />\nThe young ones of cats, dogs and some birds attract us as does a human child. When I was a child, I wanted to adopt a kitten or a puppy as pet. I found a good breed puppy at my doorstep one day. But it created a commotion in the house. My mother got irritated at the veiy presence of pets in the house. They bite and bark, enter the kitchen or sit on our beds and make things dirty. But I assured her that I would look after my puppy and train it. The loyal dog would act as security guard and a playmate. My parents finally relented and let me have the poor puppy as a pet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Writing &nbsp;(Page 96)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Imagine you have a new pet that keeps you busy. Write a paragraph describing your pet, the things it does, and the way it makes you feel. Here are some words and phrases that you could use.</strong></p>\n\n<p>frisky, smart, disobedient, loyal, happy, enthusiastic, companion, sharing, friend, rolls in mud, dirties the bed, naughty,&nbsp;lively, playful, eats up food, hides the newspaper, drinks up milk, runs away when called, floats on the water as if dead.<br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong><br />\nI have taken a kitten as my pet. It is female with silky fur and skin. She keeps me busy. My mother does not take interest in my pet. She curses the little one for doing mischief, for moving about in the house, for making the bed and floor dirty. The kitten enters the kitchen and drinks up milk. She is naughty and disobedient also. She is most unlike a dog which is loyal, obedient and strong. Still I like my pet because it is lively, playful and frisky.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Human life is dependent on nature (that&rsquo;s why we call her Mother Nature). We take everything from nature to live our lives. Do we give back anything to nature?</strong><br />\n<strong>(i) Write down some examples of the natural resources that we use.</strong><br />\n<strong>(ii) Write a paragraph expressing your point of view regarding our relationship with nature.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong></p>\n\n<p>(i) Man and nature are complementary to each other. Man for ages has been using forests, minerals and chemicals for his survival. Earth and nature are our lifelines. They help us directly or indirectly. Take for example the paper we print, our books and newspapers. They are products of trees. We get fruits, flowers and fodder from nature. We get water and air free from nature. It is unfortunate that we are over using the limited resources and are also polluting them.</p>\n\n<p>Nature is our Mother. We must not use up anything to the extent that it is not restored naturally. By cutting down trees or killing whales we are, in a way, depriving our children of their share. Let us give back to nature for the benefits we get from it.</p>\n\n<p>(ii) Some of the natural resources that we use are water, coal, mineral oil, etc.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. In This is Jody&rsquo;s Fawn, Jody&rsquo;s father uses a &ldquo;home remedy&rsquo; for a snake bite. What&nbsp;</strong><strong>should a person now do if he or she is bitten by a snake? Are all snakes poisonous?</strong><br />\n<strong>With the help of your teacher and others, find out answers to such questions. Then write a short paragraph on&mdash;What to do if a snake chooses to bite you.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong><br />\nSnakes are the most dreaded of wild creatures. This is why we use sticks to kill them. There are many poisonous snakes. Green snakes or water snakes are not poisonous. Still we cannot be sure of it. So we don&rsquo;t take a chance. We call in a snake charmer to draw the cobra out of the house. A snake-bite can kill the victim in a few minutes. But the victim can be saved if he gets the first aid in the form of blood-letting and anti-venom serum. The cure for snake bite is prepared front the snake&rsquo;s poison.</p>\n\n<p>In case I am bitten by a poisonous snake, the first thing I would do is to put a band tightly over the bitten part. Then I shall use a blade or knife to make a small cut on the bitten part, and press the poisonous blood out. Then I shall go to hospital for medical help. I shall not go to sleep until I feel better and safe.</p>\n",
                "<p><strong>MORE QUESTIONS SOLVED</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>I. SHORT ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. When and why does Jody&rsquo;s father need a remedy?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Penny, Jody&rsquo;s father, is bitten by a poisonous rattlesnake. Instead of going to a doctor, he kills a she deer and uses her liver to draw out the poison.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. How does Jody react to the cruelty of his father?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Jody, the small boy, tells his father that he had left the fawn alone and defenceless to die. So it is their moral duty to save the innocent and hungry young one of the doe.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. How does Penny take his son&#39;s argument?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Penny agreed with Jody&rsquo;s argument that it would be ungrateful to leave the fawn to starve.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. What did Doc Wilson say about Jody&rsquo;s suggestion?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Doc Wilson said that they had to pay the price for everything. He justified the plan of Jody and Penny about the fawn.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Why did Jody see only vultures and kites feeding on the dead body of the doe?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The sand showed large footprints of tigers or leopards but they did not eat up the dead doe. The reason was that the big cats killed an animal themselves to eat its flesh. Vultres and kites are birds of prey. They also feed on the dead bodies.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. How did Jody approach and win the trust of the fawn?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The fawn shook with fear as Jody drew near. It lifted its nose and scented the visitor. Jody moved forward on all fours and put his arms around its body.</p>\n\n<p><strong>7. How did Jody feel as he touched the fawn&rsquo;s skin?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Jody found the fawn&rsquo;s skin very soft and clean. He stroked its sides gently as though it were made of clay and would break soon.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8. How did Jody feed the fawn?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Jody decided to give away his share of milk to the fawn. He poured the milk into a small pot. Then he dipped his fingers in the milk and put them into its mouth. The fawn sucked slowly until the milk vanished.</p>\n\n<p><strong>10. What message does the story of the fawn convey to the readers?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The story highlights two things. It is not fair to kill an animal for its use as a cure. Secondly, one should have pity and love for the animals.</p>\n\n<p><strong>II. LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. How did Jody persuade his father to go to the forest to bring back the fawn?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Jody was a small, brave and sensitive boy. He was with his father when he (his father) was bitten by a rattlesnake. His father quickly killed a doe and used its heart and liver to draw out the snake&rsquo;s poison. Jody was happy to see that his father got a new life but at the same time he was worried for the little fawn who was left alone without its mother. He wanted to bring back the fawn. He requested his father to allow him to go to the forest to find the fawn. He told him that he didn&rsquo;t need to drink milk because he was now a big boy. He would give the milk to the fawn. He also said that it was ungrateful to leave the fawn to starve. His father was in a fix. He couldn&rsquo;t say &ldquo;no&rsquo; to his son. And finally allowed him (Jody) to go to the forest to find the fawn.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. How did Jody feed the little fawn?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Jody poured milk into a small gourd. He dipped his fingers in the milk and thrust them into the fawn&rsquo;s soft wet mouth. It sucked greedily. When he withdrew them, it bleated frantically and butted him. He dipped his fingers again and as the fawn sucked, he lowered them slowly into the milk. The fawn blew and sucked and snorted. It stamped its small hoofs impatiently. As long as he held his fingers below the level of the milk, the fawn was content.</p>\n"

Who is Stephen Hawking?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Stephen Hawking is a great scientist, an astrophysicist. But he is disabled. He has written the book &#39;A Brief History of Time&#39;. He can express himself only through a computer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. What took the author Firdaus to England? Why did he wish to see Hawking?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Firdaus Kanga visited Britain in order to write a book about his travels. He himself could move only in a wheel-chair. On the advice of his guide, Kanga planned to meet the most brilliant and completely paralysed astrophysicist (Hawking) in Cambridge.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. How did Kanga fix the interview with Hawking?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Kanga phoned Hawking and requested the scientist&rsquo;s assistant to arrange the interview. He asked for ten minutes but he got half an hour.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. What advice do people usually give to the disabled? Was Hawking brave by choice?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The people generally advise the disabled to be brave. Hawking admitted truthfully that he hadn&rsquo;t been brave. In fact, he had had no choice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. What advice does the scientist give to the handicapped?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;He advises the disabled people to concentrate on what they are good at. They should not tiy to copy the normal people.</p>\n\n<p><strong>II.LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Write about Stephen Hawking and Firdaus Kanga.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Both of them are disabled people. Stephen Hawking is one of the greatest scien&shy;tists of our time. He suffers from paralysis that confines him to a wheelchair, and allows him to &lsquo;speak&rsquo; only by punching buttons on a computer, which speaks for him in a machine like voice.<br />\nFirdaus Kanga is a writer and journalist. He lives and works in Mumbai. He was bom with &lsquo;brittle bones&rsquo; that tended to break easily when he was a child. Like Hawking, Kanga moves around in a wheelchair.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Why did the writer feel guilty talking to Stephen Hawking?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The writer felt guilty every time he spoke to Stephen Hawking because by doing this he forced him to respond. There he (Hawking) was, tapping at the little&nbsp;switch in his hand, trying to find the words on his computer with the only bit of movement left to him, his long, pale fingers. His eyes would often shut in frustrated exhaustion. The writer could feel his anguish but he had no option. He had gone to his house to talk to him on certain points.</p>\n"

How does the author describe them?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The seasonal visitors are a leopard, several thousand leeches and different kinds of birds. The leopard created nuisance. It lifted a dog from near the servants&rsquo; quarter below the school. In the evening, it attacked one of Bijju&rsquo;s cows.&nbsp;The scarlet minivets flitted silently among the leaves like brilliant jewels. No matter how leafy the trees, these brightly coloured birds could not conceal themselves. There was also a pair of drongos. They looked aggressive and chased the minivets away.A tree creeper moved rapidly up the trunk of the oak tree, snapping up insects, all the way.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Sum up the main ideas of the author&#39;s Monsoon Diary in about 100 word.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;The writer was in Mussoorie, a hill station in U.P. The first day of moonsoon&nbsp;brought mist. The birds got silent and the hills became invisible. On June 25, came the early monsoon rain. He described the hill station as A paradise&rsquo; that might have been&rsquo; to a school boy. With the onset of the monsoon one could see leopards and leeches and the colourful minivet birds. There was no dearth of insects for the birds to eat. On August 2, it rained heavily and non-stop. The roofs began to leak. The rain stopped on August 3. The sunlight fell on the hills and the song birds began to sing. On August 12, there was heavy downpour and mist for more than a week. Everything was damp. Meanwhile wild flowers began to appear. August 31 saw the greenery at its peak. Snakes and rodents came out of their flooded holes and hid in roofs or godowns. Winter rain, hailstones and snow came on October 3. The author couldn&rsquo;t go outside and he felt very lonely in his room. Late March saw the end of winter. He received a cheque in the mail.</p>\n"

It was formed on the side of a mountain by some huge rocks. They had been thrown together in such a position so that, when viewed from some distance, they resembled the face of a human face. If the spectator approached too near, the outline of the face would disappear into a heap of gigantic rocks. It was the belief of many people that the valley owed much of its fertility to the kind face of the Great Stone that was continually looking over it.</p>\n\n<p>(ii) Young Ernest gazed at the Great Stone Face.

What are some of the things we do to be called traditional? Do you find these things useless or useful?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Ours is a traditional and conservative society.

On one occasion the children said: &ldquo;How happy we are here!&rdquo;</strong><br />\n<strong>Later they said: &ldquo;How happy we were there!&rdquo;</strong><br />\n<strong>What are they referring to in both the cases?</strong><br />\n<strong>3. (i) When spring came, it was still winter in the garden. What does winter stand for&nbsp;</strong><strong>or indicate here?</strong><br />\n<strong>(ii) Winter has been presented like a story with its own characters and their activities.&nbsp;</strong><strong>Describe the story in your own words.</strong><br />\n<strong>4. Was the Giant happy or sad over the state of the garden?</strong><br />\n<strong>5. What effect did the linnet&rsquo;s song have over Hail and the North W</strong>ind?</p>\n\n<p><strong>Answers:</strong><br />\n1. The Giant was called selfish because he wanted to keep his garden reserved only for himself. He banned the entry of outsiders there.</p>\n\n<p>2. In both the cases the children are referring to the Giant&rsquo;s garden. In the first sentence they say that they are enjoying in the giant&rsquo;s garden. But in the second sentence it is beyond their reach.</p>\n\n<p>3. (i) Winter indicates that flowers did not bloom in the Giant&rsquo;s garden. The birds<br />\ndidn&rsquo;t sing. There was no sign of joy and greenery.<br />\n(ii) Winter has been portrayed as destroyer. It has its own characters. Snow and frost are the most prominent factors. Trees have been covered with white cloak. The trees look lifeless. North wind has come to stay there permanently. Hails settle on the roof.</p>\n\n<p>4.The Giant felt sad to see the state of his garden. Different seasons brought no change in it.</p>\n\n<p>5. As an effect of the linnet&rsquo;s song the Hail stopped dancing over his head. Similarly the North Wind ceased roaring.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Comprehension Check &nbsp;(Page 24)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. (i) The Giant saw a most wonderful sight. What did he see?</strong><br />\n<strong>(ii) What did he realise on seeing it?</strong><br />\n<strong>2. Why was it still winter in one comer of the garden?</strong><br />\n<strong>3. Describe the first meeting of the little boy and the Giant.</strong><br />\n<strong>4. Describe their second meeting after a long interval.</strong><br />\n<strong>5. The Giant lay dead, all covered with white blossoms. What does this sentence indicate about the once selfish Giant?</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answers:</strong><br />\n1.(i) The Giant saw that through a little hole in the wall the children had entered<br />\ninto the garden. They were sitting in the branches of the trees. In every tree that he could see there was a little child. And the trees were glad to have the children back again that they had covered themselves with blossoms and were waning their hands gently above the child run&rsquo;s heads. The birds were flying and twittering with delight, and flowers were laughing.<br />\n(ii) He realised that he himself was to blame for the year round winter in his garden. He called himself selfish.</p>\n\n<p>2. Only in one comer of the garden there was winter still. The reason was that a little boy could not climb the tree like other boys. He stood under a tree weeping.</p>\n\n<p>3. In the first meeting of the boy and the Giant, the Giant lifted him gently and put him in the branch of that tree. The tree suddenly broke into flowers and the birds began to sing. The child kissed the Giant.</p>\n\n<p>4. In the second meeting after so many years, the Giant saw wounds on the little boy&#39;s palm and feet. He became furious. He wanted to kill the man who had wounded the child. But the boy said that those were wounds of love.</p>\n\n<p>5. This indicates that the Giant had been blessed by Lord Christ himself. He was neither cruel nor selfish So Christ forgave him and took him to paradise.</p>\n",

The little child&#39;s hands arid feet had marks of nails. Who does the child remind you of? Give a reason for your answer.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The nail&rsquo;s marks on the child&#39;s hands and feet remind us of Lord Christ. He was put on a cross and nails were hammered into his palms and feet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Is there something like this garden near where you live? Would you like one (without the Giant perhaps) and why? What would you do to keep it in good shape?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>A park is a public place. It is like the lungs in human body. It gives us fresh air. The greenery is soothing to the eyes. A private garden, however, has to be used by the people with care and caution. The children must not spoil the flower beds and the grassy lawns even in a public park. I would never play football in a park nor let other children do so.</p>\n\n<p><strong>MORE QUESTIONS SOLVED</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>I. SHORT ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Describe in brief the Giant&rsquo;s garden.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The Giant&rsquo;s garden was very beautiful. It had soft green grass. Here and there&nbsp;over the grass stood beautiful flowers like stars and there were twelve peach trees that in the spring time broke out into delicate blossoms of pink and pearl, and in autumn bore rich fruit.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Where had the Giant gone? What did he see when he arrived?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The Giant had gone to his friend, the Cornish Ogre and had stayed with him for seven years. When he arrived he saw the children playing in the garden.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Why did he build a high wall round his garden?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>He didn&rsquo;t want children to play in his garden. Therefore, he built a high wall round it in order to stop them from entering it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. What happened to the Giant&rsquo;s garden when the spring came?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>All over the country there were little blossoms and little words. But the Giant&rsquo;s garden remained deprived of them. There was still winter there instead of the spring. The birds didn&rsquo;t care to sing in it, as there were no children and the trees forgot to blossom.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. What changes came to be noticed in the Giant&rsquo;s behaviour?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Previously he was a selfish Giant. He didn&rsquo;t like children and their playing in his garden. But one day he realised his fault and became affectionate towards them. He opened his garden for them. He began to play with them.</p>\n",
                "<p><strong>II. LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Who did the Giant love most? Why?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Giant loved the little boy most because he had kissed him. He felt helpless and began to cry. The Giant saw him. His heart melted all of a sudden. He came to the little boy and put him into the tree. The tree broke at once into blossom and the birds came and sang on it. The little boy became happy. He stretched out his two arms and flung them round the Giant&rsquo;s neck, and kissed him. The Giant&rsquo;s joy knew no bounds. He (the Giant) made the little boy his friend.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. What evidence do you find in the story about the Giant&rsquo;s selfishness and wicked nature? Did he stick to this? How do you know?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The Giant was self centred and wicked. He wanted his garden only for his own use. He forbade the entry of children there. He put up a notice board that who soever entered the garden without his permission would be punished. He also got a high wall constructed all around it. Children were horrified to see this. They flew away from the garden. It shows the giant&rsquo;s selfishness and wicked nature. But he didn&#39;t stick to this. He became soft towards the children. He broke the wall that he had constructed around his garden and allowed the children to play there. He regarded the children as the most beautiful flowers of all.</p>\n"

What does the title of the lesson &lsquo;The Treasure Within&rsquo; mean and highlight?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The Treasure Within&rsquo; refers to the hidden talent of every child who has his own style of learning and area of interest.

What does he tell about himself to his interviewer? How does he find his calling?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Hafeez Contractor is a leading architect in India at present. In this interview he traces the story of his childhood and schooldays. He had little interest in studies. He passed the annual examinations by copying. He used to be a good sportsman.

How did the&nbsp;Principal&rsquo;s words influence Hafeez Contractor?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The Principal was a sensible man. He had been seeing Hafeez from day one. He thought it as his duty to guard him on right time. So, when Hafeez approached his eleventh standard, he called him and told him that he was a good student but he never studied. He had lost his father and his poor mother had worked hard to bring him up and pay his fees. It was the time now to rise to the occasion and study. These words of the Principal influenced Hafeez deeply. He forgot games that year and studied day and night. As a result, he got a second class, 50 per cent in his SSC. His Principal was very happy because he had got 50 per cent on his own.</p>\n"

Give a brief account of your heart breaks, sufferings and eventual happiness.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;I am the ninth daughter of the royal couple of Siam. My father,- the King, used to give gifts to us on his birthdays. One year, on his birthday he gave each one of the princesses a green parrot in a golden cage. I also got a parrot in a golden cage. All other sisters taught the bird to say &lsquo;God save the King&rsquo; and &lsquo;Pretty Polly&rsquo;. But I was different from them. Unfortunately my parrot died one day. I wept and wept. I slept without supper. At night a small song bird flew into my room. It sang so sweetly that I forgot the loss of my parrot. I showed it to my sisters. They grew jealous of my happiness. They advised me to put the bird in a cage. And I acted foolishly upon that advice. The bird stopped singing. It appeared to be dead. So I set it free. I then had the last laugh. I was married to a Prince of Combodia while my sisters were ugly and were married to my father&rsquo;s councillors.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Compare and contrast the characters of Princess September and her other eight sisters.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Princess September was different from her elder sisters. She was sweet-natured and simple-hearted. She cried bitterly when her parrot died. A little bird made her happy with his song. Her sisters were jealous, mean and wicked. They made a plan to rob her of her happiness. They told her to put the bird in a cage. Their wicked plan worked for a while. The bird stopped singing in captivity. Princess September cared more for the bird&rsquo;s life than her own happiness. So she let him off. She was duly rewarded for her goodness.</p>\n"

                "<p><strong>Exercise &nbsp;(Page 54)</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Discuss the following topics in small groups.</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. Is fighting the only way of resolving differences of opinion? What else can be done to reach a mutually acceptable settlement?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Fighting is not the only way to resolve a dispute. The best course is to start a dialogue with a cool head. In case they fail to agree on any point, they can appoint an arbiter or middleman acceptable to both.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Have you ever been in a serious fight only to realise later that it was unnecessary and futile? Share your experience/views with others frankly and honestly.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;People usually quarrel over minor issues which can be resolved over a cup of tea. Such violent quarrels harm both the parties. In a war, no party actually wins. Both suffer equally and feel sony later on. Every person can recall one or two occasions of this type.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Why do some of us find it necessary to prove that we are better than others? Will you be amused or annoyed to read the following sign at the back of the car in front of you?I May be going slow but I am ahead of you.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;It is our common weakness to do better than others or to pull somebody down. Some pretend to be superior to others and try to hurt them. This is, in fact, a symptom of their inferiority complex.

Narrate the episode of the fight between Ranji and Suraj in the forest in about 100-125 words.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Ranji was a thin built boy, fond of swimming. Once he discovered a pool in the forest. It was a hot summer day. He got into the pool. Soon a boy, taller and stronger than him, arrived there. He said that it was his pool and he would swim alone. He tried to frighten Ranji. He called himself a warrior. Ranji stood his ground and proclaimed himself a fighter. The two fought over the right to the pool. Both were tired and exhausted in the very fist fight. In the second fight, they faced each other across the pool. They challenged each other. Ranji was decidedly a better swimmer than Suraj. He could dive and swim under water. He established his superiority over his adversary. Now the two agreed to help each other rather than fight. Ranji promised to teach Suraj the art of swimming. Suraj offered to make Ranji a wrestler. They became friends.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Compare and contrast the character traits of the two adversaries or contestants in the story &lsquo;The Fight&rsquo;.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Suraj was a tall, thickset wrestler. He was a bully. He proclaimed that he was a warrior and he had exclusive right to swim in the pool. He tried to scare Ranji away. But Ranji had a strong feeling of self respect. He accepted the challenge to fight. He thought if he surrendered he would lose his right to the pool for ever. He suffered cuts and bruises. But he went to the pool ready for a second fight. This time he proved his excellence as a swimmer. Suraj got influenced by Ranji&rsquo;s art of swimming. He also wanted to be a good swimmer. So he agreed to get training from Ranji and in return make Ranji a wrestler.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. In the fight between Ranji and Suraj, who was the winner?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Ranji was physically no match for Suraj, the tall wrestler. Yet they fought over the right to use the pool. Ranji suffered cuts and bruises all over his body, but he refused to surrender or accept defeat. In the first round the fight ended in a draw. Next day they faced each other across the pool for a second round of fight. But Ranji this time proved himself a better swimmer than his adversary. They fought together to learn something worthwhile. They suspended the fight after a while and became good friends. Hence neither was the winner.</p>\n"

How did the coins persuade the boy to buy jalebis?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The coins told the boy that the jalebis were fresh, crisp and syrupy. They were meant to be eaten and only those with money in their pocket could eat them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. How did the boy respond to the coins?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The boy didn&rsquo;t heed to the coins. He was a good and intelligent boy. He told the coins not to misguide him.

Why did the boy hold all the four coins tight in his fist?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>All the four coins began to speak at the same time in order to make the boy ready to buy the jalebis.

Comment on the significance of the jalebis in the story.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>Jalebis are central to the story. These are hot, fresh and syrupy. A school boy falls to the sweet temptation of jalebis. He spends all his school fees money in buying jalebis. He eats himself and also distributes them among children. He regrets his weakness later. He prays to God to send him four rupees. But he gets no help from God. He realises in later life that God cannot meet everybody&rsquo;s demand. Were he so generous, man would not have developed the skill of making jalebis.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. Write a short note on the character of the schoolboy in Jalebis.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The schoolboy in the story Jalebis carries four rupees to school to pay the school fees. He is honest, God fearing and brilliant student. He has won a scholarship also. He has never been punished. He enjoys prestige. He feels shy of standing in the bazaar and eating jalebis. But the coins in his pocket persuade him to go wrong. And he repents his foolishness. He asks for God&rsquo;s help. He can recite the namaz and some portions from the Quran. His experience, however, teaches him a valuable lesson.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. How does the schoolboy try to please God to come to his rescue?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>The schoolboy faces a crisis after he has spent his school fees on the jalebis. He turns to AUah Miyan for help. He apologises to God. He promises to never repeat that mistake, and recites the namaaz and few verses from the Quran. He hopes in vain that Gdtt will put money under the rock. He plays a game with God. But he finds no coins but a hairy worm under the rock.</p>\n"

What did Indrani Debi think about Duttada&rsquo;s telescope?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Indrani Debi thought that Duttada&rsquo;s telescope was like a designing woman who had ensnared her husband. She used to call it Dibya.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. What news was published in the Ananda Bazaar Patrika two days later?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The news was&nbsp;Calcutta Man Discovers New Comet&nbsp;Shri Manoj Dutta, a resident on the northern outskirts of Calcutta has claimed to have discovered a new comet. He has seen the comet on the last two nights and has informed the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) at Bangalore of its whereabouts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. What did the Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) do after getting the infor&shy;mation about the discovery of the new comet?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Indian Institute of Astrophysics (IIA) confirmed the findings and communi&shy;cated it worldwide. It named the new comet after its discoverer.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. How did Duttada take his publicity?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Duttada was not happy with his publicity. Being an introvert, he didn&rsquo;t like at&shy;tending numerous receptions and functions organised in his honour. He got so fed up that he began to think that he had not discovered the comet.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. How can you say that Indrani Debi was a superstitious lady?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Indrani Debi was an educated woman but at the same time she was supersti&shy;tious also. She didn&rsquo;t welcome the discovery of the new comet. She thought that it would bring calamities on her family as well as on the entire earth.</p>\n",
                "<p><strong>II. LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>1. What was Duttada&rsquo;s hobby and secret ambition? How did he succeed in his adventure?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Duttada was an amateur astronomer. Star gazing was his hobby. But he had a scientific attitude. His secret ambition in life was to discover a comet or a shooting star. After his retirement he got the funds to buy a telescope and leisure enough to watch the stars. He named his eight-inch telescope Dibya-chakshu. He was successful in search. He discovered a comet heading towards the earth. It was called Dutta comet. The news spread world over. James Forsyth predicted that the comet would collide with the earth and destroy it. Dutta&rsquo;s wife, Indrani Debi, was afraid that the comet would cause ruin. She arranged a Yajna to pacify the evil spirit behind the comet. But the world scientists prepared a plan to make a nuclear explosion and deflect the comet from its path. The operation was named Project Light Brigade. It was successful. The world was saved. But Indrani Debi gave all credit to the holy yajna she got performed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>2. How does the new comet create a commotion in the world? How was the disaster averted at last?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Duttada took up star gazing as a hobby. His secret ambition was to discover a new comet. He used a small telescope and discovered a comet heading towards the earth. James Forsyth calculated that the comet would hit the earth in ten months. Comet Dutta created a commotion and panic among the scientists. Sir John Macpherson prepared a secret plan to give a push to the deadly comet. It was called Project Light Brigade. The operation was successful and the disaster&nbsp;was averted. But Duttada&rsquo;s wife attributed the safety of the earth to the yajna she had performed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>3. Bring out the difference in outlook of Duttada and his wife in respect of the&nbsp;new comet. Who do you think deserves the crown of victory? &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Duttada was an amateur scientist. Star gazing was his hobby. His secret ambition was to discover a new comet. He pursued his hobby firmly. He discovered a comet, heading towards the earth. He knew it could hit and destroy the earth. But the crisis could be averted by exploding a nuclear payload near the comet. This was a sensible and scientific approach. But his wife Indrani Debi was a superstitious woman. She went by what the priests said. To avert the ill-effect of the discoveiy, she organised a yajna. In the end she gave all credit for the safely of the earth to the yajna.</p>\n\n<p><strong>4. What were James Forsyth&rsquo;s predictions&rsquo;? What did he mean by rare circumstances?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;James Forsyth predicted that the effect of the collision between the comet and the earth would be terrific. Their assessment was based on the calculations.&nbsp;The collision was unavoidable unless the comet split up near the sun and disappeared. Or it might collide with some other comet before reaching the earth.&nbsp;Otherwise, the comet would take ten months to hit the earth. &nbsp;These were the two rare circumstances.</p>\n"

It helps to turn the soil and loosen it to allow the root to penetrate deep into it. The loosening of the soil helps in the growth of several soil microbes, earthworms etc., which enrich the soil with humus and other essential nutrients. The process of turning and loosening is called ploughing.This is done using a plough, hoe and cultivators.</p>\n\n<p>(b) Sowing is the process of putting the seeds into the soil for growing crops. We need to use quality seeds for sowing. Sowing is done manually are mechanical equipment like Seed Drill. Seeds of few plants like rice is first grown in a separate area and then transplanted in the fields.</p>\n\n<p>(c) In a field many other undesirable plants may grow along with the crop. These undesirable plants are called weeds. Farmers use many ways to remove weeds. Methods to control weeds are: Tilling before sowing of crops, physical removal of weeds by uprooting or cutting them close to the ground, using certain chemicals called weedicides etc.</p>\n\n<p>(d) Threshing is the process of separating grains or seeds from chaff. It is done after harvesting the crop. It is usually carried out with the help of a machine known as &#39;Combine&#39;. This machine is a combined harvester and thresher. It harvests plants as well as cleans grains.</p>\n",

What is irrigation? Describe two methods of irrigation which conserve water.<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nSupply of water to crops at appropriate intercals is called irrigation. The time and frequency of irrigation varies according to different seasons, crops, and soil types.<br />\nTwo methods of irrigation which help in conservation of water are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Sprinkler system: This system is more useful on uneven land, having fewer water supplies. In this method, water is supplied using pipes to one or more central locations within the field. When water is allowed to flow under high pressure with the help of a pump, it gets sprinkled on the crops.</li>\n\t<li>Drip system: In this system, water is delivered at or near the roots of plants, drop by drop. This is the most efficient method of irrigation as there is no wastage of water at all. This method is important in areas where water availability is poor.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>7. If wheat is sown in the kharif season, what would happen? Discuss.<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nIf wheat is sown in the kharif season (from June to October), then the whole crop might get destroyed because of many factors such as lack of optimum temperature, adaptability, availability of pests, etc. Kharif season includes the rainy season, which is not favourable for the growth of wheat crop. Therefore, wheat crop should not be sown during this season.</p>\n\n<p><strong>8. Explain how soil gets affected by the continuous plantation of crops in a field.<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nIf continuous plantation of crops is done in the fields then the soil will become poor in necessary nutrients like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, etc. Plants require nutrients for their proper growth and functioning. When a farmer continues to grow crops one after the other, then all nutrients available in the soil reduce and the crop yield decreases automatically.</p>\n\n<p><strong>9. What are weeds? How can we control them?<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nWeeds are unwanted wild plants that grow in the field. Weeds compete with the crop for nutrients, light, and space. As a result, crop plants get lesser nutrients, light, and space for their development.<br />\nSome important weeding methods are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Weeds can be controlled using weedicides. It is a chemical, which is sprayed in the fields to kill all available weeds. Weedicides are not harmful to crops.</li>\n\t<li>Tilling before sowing of crops also helps in removing weeds. Tilling uproots the weeds. The best time for the removal of weeds is before they produce flowers and seeds.</li>\n\t<li>The manual method of removing weeds is with the help of a khurpi. It involves regular uprooting or cutting of weeds close to the ground.</li>\n</ul>\n",

During puberty, there is a sudden increase in height of both boys and girls. On the basis of the above graph, it can be observed that during the age of 4-8 years, girls have less height as compared to boys. However, as soon as girls reach 12- 13 years, their height shows a sudden increase and becomes more than boys. In later years, growth in both sexes becomes stable. Growth during puberty is under the control of hormones.</p>\n"

This can damage the machines.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>10. Explain why objects moving in fluids must have special shapes.<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nWhen a body moves through a fluid, it experiences an opposing force which tries to oppose its motion through the fluid. This opposing force is known as the drag force. This frictional force depends on the shape of the body. By giving objects a special shape, the force of friction acting on it can be minimised. Hence, it becomes easier for the body to move through the fluid.</p>\n"

Sometimes, a crackling sound is heard while taking off a sweater during winters. Explain.<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nSweater is made of wool and generally shirt we wear is made of cotton blended with some synthetic fibers. Constant friction between the shirt and sweeter lets transfer of electrons from one material to the other. This results in building of electric potential. When enough potential has been accumulated, while taking of the sweater it discharges and transfer of electrons take place. Passage of electrons through air in the forms of spark let out heat and sound energy. Thus we hear the crackling sound and in dark rooms we may see the spark lights as well.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Explain why a charged body loses its charge if we touch it with our hand.<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nWhen we touch a charged body, with our hand, the excess of accumulated charge or static charges on it, gets transfer to ground through our body. Thus the charged body loses its charge, and becomes neutral.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. Name the scale on which the destructive energy of an earthquake is measured. An earthquake measures 3 on this scale.

Suppose you have to go out on that day. Would you carry an umbrella? Explain.<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nNo. We should not carry an umbrella in a thunderstorm. During thunderstorms, which are accompanied with lightning, electric discharge from the clouds can travel through the metallic rod of the umbrella. This may give an electric shock to the person who is carrying it. Hence, it is not safe to carry an umbrella during lightning.<br />\n&nbsp;</p>\n"

Describe an activity to show that the incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal at the point of incidence lie in the same plane.<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nPlace a plane mirror on the table. Take a paper sheet and make a small hole in its centre. Make sure that the light in the room is not bright. Hold the sheet normal to the table. Take another sheet and place it on the table in contact with the vertical mirror. Draw a normal line on the second sheet from the mirror. Now, light a torch on the mirror through the small hole such that the ray of light falls on the normal at the bottom of the mirror. When the ray from this hole is incident on the mirror, it gets reflected in a certain direction. You can easily observe the incident ray, reflected ray and the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence on the sheet placed on the table. This shows that the incident ray, the reflected ray, and the normal to the surface at the point of incidence all lie in the same plane.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://learncbse-test.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/627ddd89-70c9-4ccd-8e3b-e3668cc51dfb_Light-1.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" /></p>\n\n<p><strong>6.

One light year is equal to 9.46 x 10<sup>12</sup>km.<br />\nA star is located eight light years away from the Earth. This means that the distance between the star and the Earth is equivalent to the distance travelled by light in eight years, i.e., a star is located 8 x (9.46 x 10<sup>12</sup>) = 7.6 x 10<sup>13&nbsp;</sup>km away from the Earth.</p>\n\n<p><strong>15.

You have to deliver the speech in your class.<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nGlobal warming is one of the greatest challenges that our planet is facing. It is the unequivocal and continuing rise in the average temperature of the Earth&rsquo;s climate system. It occurs as a result of an increased concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. &nbsp;These gases trap solar radiations released back by the Earth. This helps in keeping our planet warm and thus, helps in human survival. However, an increase in the amount of greenhouse gases can lead to an increase in the Earth&#39;s temperature leading to global warming.</p>\n\n<p><strong>10. Describe the threat to the beauty of the Taj Mahal.<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nAcid rain is a major threat to the beauty of the Taj Mahal. When acid rains fall on the monument made of marble, they react with marble to form a powder-like substance that is then washed away by the rain. This phenomenon is known as marble cancer. Also, the soot particles emitted from the Mathura oil refinery located near Agra is leading to the yellowing of the marble.</p>\n\n<p><strong>11. Why does the increased level of nutrients in the water affect the survival of aquatic organisms?<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nThe increased in the level of nutrients in the water leads to an excessive increase in the population of algae in the water body. When these algae die, they serve as food for decomposers. A lot of oxygen is utilised in this process, consequently leading to a decrease in the level of oxygen dissolved in the water body. This in turn causes fishes and other aquatic organisms to die.</p>\n"

Discuss the effects of deforestation on the following.</strong></p>\n\n<p>(a) <strong>Wild animals: </strong>When forests are cut, the natural habitat of the animals is destroyed. Without the natural habitat the animals are left with no place to live and breed. As a result of this many animals are at the verge of extinction.</p>\n\n<p>(b) <strong>Environment:</strong> Environment is adversely affected by deforestation as ecological balance is disturbed. Carbon dioxide is not absorbed by plants and it gets accumulated in the atmosphere to cause global warming which increases the temprature of earth and disturb water cycle.</p>\n\n<p>(c) <strong>Villages (Ruaral Areas): </strong>Deforestation leads to soil erosion and results in flash floods. This hampers agricultural activities and thus disturbs the people in rural areas.</p>\n\n<p>(d) <strong>Cities (Urban Areas):</strong> Deforestation in cities can increase the risk of many natural calamities such as floods and droughts in that area.</p>\n\n<p>(e) <strong>Earth:</strong> The whole earth is full of various ecosystems which together make the biosphere. Deforestation disturbs the balance in the biosphere. It disturbs climatic patterns.</p>\n\n<p>(f) <strong>The next generation: </strong>They will not be able to see wide variety of flora and fauna also not get clean and cool environment.

If the habitat of an animal is disturbed, then it will be forced to go to other places in search of food and shelter. The animal could get killed by other animals in this process.</p>\n\n<p>(c) If the top layer of soil is exposed, then it will gradually expose the lower layer of soil, which is hard and rocky in nature. This type of soil is less fertile as it contains less humus. Continued soil erosion will make the land barren or infertile.</p>\n\n<p><strong>5. Answer in brief:</strong><br />\n<strong>(a) Why should we conserve biodiversity?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong><br />\nWe should conserve biodiversity because it is very important for all living organisms and for the environment. We should conserve biodiversity to save it from becoming extinct.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(b) Protected forests are also not completely safe for wild animals. Why?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong><br />\nProtected forests are not completely safe for wild animals because people who live near or adjacent to forests use resources from forests to fulfil their own requirements. In this process, wild animals are killed and sold for lucrative amounts of money.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(c) Some tribals depend on the jungle. How?<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nTribals gather food, fodder, and fallen branches of trees from forests. Hence, they depend on forests for their daily requirements.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(d) What are the causes and consequences of deforestation?<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nThe main cause of deforestation is growing urbanization and industrialization. Need for more land and resources have lead to the cutting down of forests.<br />\nConsequences of deforestation are as follows:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Soil erosion</li>\n\t<li>Depletion of groundwater</li>\n\t<li>Flash flood</li>\n\t<li>Global warming</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>(e) What is Red Data Book?<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nRed Data Book is a source book that maintains an international list of all endangered animal and plant species.</p>\n\n<p><strong>(f) What do you understand by the term migration?<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nMigration refers to the movement of an organism or a group of organisms from its natural habitat to another place at a particular time every year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>6. In order to meet the ever-increasing demand in factories and for shelter, trees are being continually cut. Is it justified to cut trees for such projects? Discuss and prepare a brief report.<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nNo. It is not at all justified to cut trees to meet the ever increasing demands of human population. Forests are the habitat of several organisms including wild animals. They provide us with good quality air as they give out O<sub>2</sub> and absorb the harmful CO<sub>2</sub> gas from the atmosphere. In the process, they prevent the excessive heating of the atmosphere. They prevent soil erosion and natural calamities such as floods and droughts. They increase the fertility of the soil and help conserve biodiversity. The cutting of forests to meet the demands of growing human population will lead to global warming, soil erosion, greenhouse effect, droughts, floods, and many more problems. The destruction of forests will disturb the balance of nature. Hence, forests must be conserved.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",

Explain how deforestation leads to reduced rainfall.<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nPlants absorb water from the soil and evaporates it to form clouds. Deforestation leads to cutting down of trees. As a result less water is absorbed from the soil and it disturbs the water cycle. The formation of clouds become difficult which leads to reduced rainfall.</p>\n\n<p><strong>10. Why should paper be saved? Prepare a list of ways by which you can save paper.<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nPaper should be saved because it takes around seventeen full grown trees to make one tonne of paper.

Explain the importance of reproduction in organisms.<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nReproduction is very important for the organisms. The organisms reproduce to produce young ones like them. It helps to carry on their generation. If reproduction does not take place, no living being will survive on the earth.

Describe the process of fertilization in human beings.<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nFertilization involves the fusion of the male and the female gamete. The male and the female gametes are released from the male and the female reproductive organs. Sperms or male gametes are released from the male reproductive organ i.e., the penis. These sperms then enter the female body through the vagina. Then, they travel through the fallopian tubes where they meet the eggs. Hence, the process of fertilization takes place in the fallopian tubes. During fertilization, the haploid nucleus of the sperm and that of the ovum fuse with each other to form the zygote.

According to the Interim constitution drafted in 2007, the executive powers of Nepal are in the hands of the council of ministers headed by the Prime Minister.<br />\nThere was a dire need for a new constitution as the ideals of the people had changed as the country had moved from a monarchy to a democracy. The old constitution was drafted when the country was under the rule of the king. The people of Nepal fought for a democratic government for many years. So the old constitution does not reflect the ideals of the people. The new constitution will change the rules of the old constitution in order to bring in a new society with new ideals.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3</strong><br />\nWhat would happen if there were no restrictions on the power of elected representatives?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nIf there are no restrictions on the power of the elected representatives the leaders might misuse the powers given to them. The Indian Constitution provides safeguards against this misuse of power by our political leaders. The Constitution lays down rules that guard the citizens against misuse of power.</p>\n",

                "<p><strong>Question-1</strong><br />\nWhat are the advantages to foreign companies in setting up production in India?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nIndia provides cheap labour compared to some other countries. Wages paid to workers in foreign countries are much higher than in India. For lower pay, the foreign companies can get longer hours of work. Additional expenses such as housing facilities for workers are also fewer in India. Thus, foreign companies can save costs and earn higher profits.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-2</strong><br />\nDo you think the victims of the Bhopal gas tragedy got justice? Discuss.<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nThe victims of the Bhopal gas tragedy did not get justice. The disaster was caused due to gross neglect of safety measures by the management of the factory.<br />\nThe government of India represented the people to legally claim compensation for the affected people. The government demanded $ 3 billion but had to accept a meagre $ 470 million from the Company.<br />\nToday, 24 years after the disaster, people of Bhopal are still fighting for justice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-3</strong><br />\nWhat do we mean when we speak of law enforcement? Who is responsible for enforcement? Why is enforcement so important?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nLaw enforcement means to compel obedience to a law. Laws passed by the government have to be enforced otherwise the benefit of the laws will not reach the citizens. It is the duty of the government to enforce the laws.<br />\nBy enforcing and upholding these laws, the government can control the activities of individuals or private companies so as to ensure social justice. Enforcement is even more important when the law seeks to protect the weak from the strong.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-4</strong><br />\nHow can laws ensure that markets work in a manner that is fair? Give two examples to support your answer.<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nThe government has passed laws that ensure that essential products such as food grains, sugar and kerosene are not highly priced. It is necessary that such restrictions are placed on people who market these products; otherwise the poor will not be able to afford these goods.<br />\nThe government has also passed the Consumers&rsquo; Protection Act which ensures that the consumers are not cheated by the sale of sub-standard products.<br />\n&lsquo;Hallmark&rsquo; certification helps the consumer to buy standard gold ornaments and &lsquo;Agmark&rsquo; certification ensures that the food products on sale are of good quality.</p>\n",
                "<p><strong>Question-5</strong><br />\nWrite a paragraph on the various roles of the government that you have read about in this unit.<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nThe common man is exploited in most societies. When this happens it is the duty of the government to ensure that social justice prevails and all the citizens can establish their rights.<br />\nThe government has passed many laws to guarantee that workers are not exploited by unscrupulous employers. Payment of Wages Act, 1936; Minimum Wages Act, 1948; Payment of Bonus Act, 1965 are some of the Acts that ensure that workers are not underpaid and exploited.<br />\nThe government has passed the Factories Act, 1948. This Act regulates health, safety, welfare and other working conditions of workers in factories. It is enforced by the State Governments through their factory inspectorates.<br />\nThe Consumer Protection Act ensures that the consumer is not put to risk by the poor quality of products such as electrical appliances, food and medicines. The Bureau of Indian Standards is a government organization that oversees the quality of products sold.<br />\nThe government has also passed laws that ensure that essential products such as food grains, sugar and kerosene are not highly priced.<br />\nThe Environment (protection) Act, 1986, was passed to protect the environment and avert health hazards to human beings.<br />\nProhibition of Employment of Young Children protects children from being exploited. No child who has not completed his fourteenth year shall be required or allowed to work in any factory<br />\nThe Trade Unions Act, 1926 provides for registration of trade unions with a view to render lawful organisation of labour to enable collective bargaining.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-6</strong><br />\nHow was environment treated earlier? What has been the change in perception?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nIn 1984, there were very few laws to protect the environment in India. These few laws were not enforced strictly by the government. Industries discharged their waste into water bodies and made it unfit for consumption. The air was polluted with smoke that bellowed from the factories.<br />\nThis pollution proved to be a health hazard for the people. The Bhopal disaster brought the issue of environmental pollution into focus.<br />\nThe existing laws did not protect the common man from industrial disasters. Environmental activists insisted on new laws which will protect all the citizens from hazardous pollution of the environment. In response to the demand by the activists and the public, the government introduced new laws on the environmental safety.<br />\nAccording to the new laws imposed by the government the polluter will be held accountable for the damage done to the environment.<br />\nThe Right to Life is a Fundamental Right under Article 21 of the Constitution and it includes the right to the enjoyment of pollution-free water and air for full enjoyment of life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-7</strong><br />\nWhat do you think the famous cartoonist R.K. Laxman is trying to convey in this cartoon? How does it relate to the 2006 law that you read about on page 125?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nThe cartoon shows a young under privileged boy carrying the books of a well-to- do boy who is off to school. This reveals that the boy who is less than 14 years of age has been employed by the woman seen in the picture.<br />\nThe cartoon emphasises that young children are being exploited at work places. They are made to work for long hours for very little wages. These children are being denied basic education which is very essential for them.<br />\nThis is a violation of the Child Labour Prevention Act that was passed by the government in 2006. No child who has not completed his fourteenth year shall be required or allowed to work in any factory. The government has passed certain laws that will protect these children from being exploited.</p>\n",

Hall mark certification assures the consumer of the purity of gold they buy.<br />\nISO certification assures the consumer that a company has a good Quality Management System.<br />\nConsumers might be put to risk by the poor quality of products such as electrical appliances, food, medicines if the government had not set up the Bureau of Indian Standards.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-2</strong><br />\nHow can the government ensure social justice?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nThrough making, enforcing and upholding certain laws, the government can control the activities of individuals or private companies so as to ensure social justice.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-3</strong><br />\nWrite a brief note on the Bhopal gas tragedy.<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nUnion Carbide was an American Company which had a factory in Bhopal, Madhya Pradesh, India, which produced pesticides. At midnight on 2<sup>nd</sup>&nbsp;December, 1984, methyl-isocyanides - a highly poisonous gas - started leaking from the factory plant.<br />\nWithin three days, more than 8,000 people were dead. Hundreds of thousands were maimed. Most of those exposed to the poison gas came from poor, working-class families.<br />\nThere are nearly 50,000 people today who are too sick to work. Among those who survived, many developed severe respiratory disorders, eye problems and other disorders. Children developed peculiar abnormalities.<br />\nThe Bhopal disaster is frequently cited as the world&#39;s worst industrial disaster.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-4</strong><br />\nWhat were the reasons for the Bhopal tragedy?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nThe Union Carbide tank&rsquo;s alarms had not worked for 4 years. The steam boiler, intended to clean the pipes, was out of action and water sprays designed to &quot;knock down&quot; gas leaks were poorly designed. No action plans had been established to cope with incidents of this magnitude. The local authorities were not informed of the quantities or dangers of chemicals used and manufactured at the factory. These were the reasons for the Bhopal tragedy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-5</strong><br />\nWhat are the reasons for the sharp differences in safety standards between the 2 Union carbide factories in the USA and India?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nIndia has a high rate of unemployment and due to this workers are willing to work in unsafe conditions. One worker can easily replace another due to over population. Ignorance and the vulnerability of Indian workers is also another reason why the safety standards in the Indian factory were very much lower than the factory in USA.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-6</strong><br />\nIn what way was the Government responsible for the Bhopal tragedy?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nSafety laws were lax in India and these weak safety laws were not enforced.<br />\nGovernment officials refused to recognise the plant as hazardous and allowed it to come up in a populated locality. Though there was some objection regarding the safety violation, the government allowed the factory to start production as it was providing jobs for the local people.<br />\nThe government did not take the initiative to ask the Union Carbide Company to shift to cleaner technology or safer procedures. Government inspectors continued to approve the procedures in the plant, even when there were repeated incidents of poisonous gas leaks. So the government has to bear certain responsibility for the tragedy.</p>\n"

                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Extra Questions</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-1</strong><br />\nWhat is religion?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nReligion is the personal beliefs and practices relating to the divine.

Discuss why it is vital to separate the power of the state from religious practices.<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nSecularism is very essential for the smooth functioning of a democratic country. In today&rsquo;s world people go to other countries to work or do business. So you will find that people of different religions live in the same locality.<br />\nIn the event of people of different religions living together in the same locality there is a possibility that people belonging to one particular religion being in the majority. If this majority has access to State power, there is likelihood that it will use it to discriminate and dominate the minority group which practices another religion.<br />\nIn a secular democratic country any form of domination or tyranny, based on religion is in violation of the rights that a democratic society guarantees to each and every citizen irrespective of their religion.<br />\nTherefore it is important not to allow any one religion, even though it may be the majority, to violate the fundamental rights of all citizens. If this right has to be maintained it is vital to separate the power of the state from religious practices.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-6</strong><br />\nWhat are the other reasons for separating the power of the State from religion?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nPeople should have the freedom to leave the religion they have been practicing and join another religion.

In your response include a fictitious or real example of a violation of the rule of law.<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nLaw is a system of rules, usually imposed through a Government or Institution and is applied to govern a group people. It shapes politics, economics and society in numerous ways.<br />\nThe most common example of a violation of the rule of law can be seen on the roads. Motorists and pedestrians do not follow the traffic rules.<br />\nMotorists do not adhere to speed limits nor do they stop behind the line at traffic signals. Pedestrians rarely use the zebra crossing and cross the road at will causing harm not only to themselves but also to other road users.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-2</strong><br />\nState two reasons why historians refute the claim that the British introduced the rule of law in India.<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nHistorians refute the claim that the British introduced the rule of law in India because colonial law was arbitrary, and the Indian nationalists played a prominent role in the development of the legal sphere in British India.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-3</strong><br />\nRe-read the storyboard on how a new law on domestic violence got passed. Describe in your own words the different ways in which women&rsquo;s groups worked to make this happen.<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nDomestic violence against women was very common in India in the early 1990s. Throughout the 1990s, the need for a new law was raised in different forums like Public Meting and women&rsquo;s organisations. In 1999, Lawyers Collective, a group of lawyers, law students and activists, after nation-wide consultations took the lead in drafting the Domestic Violence (Prevention and Protection) Bill. This draft bill was widely circulated. Meetings were held all over the country supporting the introduction of this Act.<br />\nThe Bill was first introduced in Parliament in 2002, but it was not to the satisfaction of all. Several women&rsquo;s organisations, like the National Commission for Women made submissions to the Parliamentary Standing Committee requesting changes in the Bill. In December 2002, after reviewing the request made by the National Commission for Women, the Parliamentary Standing Committee submitted its recommendations to the Rajya Sabha and these were also tabled in the Lok Sabha. The Committee&rsquo;s report accepted most of the demands of the women&rsquo;s groups.<br />\nFinally a new Bill was reintroduced in Parliament in 2005. After being passed in both houses of Parliament, it was sent to the President for his assent. The Protection of Women from Domestic Violence Act came into effect in 2006.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-4</strong><br />\nWrite in your own words what you understand by the following sentence on page 44-45: They also began fighting for greater equality and wanted to change the idea of law from a set of rules that they were forced to obey, to law as including ideas of justice.<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nThe Sedition Act of 1870 was a turning point in the struggle for freedom in India. According to the Sedition Act any person protesting or criticising the British government could be arrested without due trial.<br />\nIndian nationalists began protesting and criticising this arbitrary use of authority by the British. They also began fighting for greater equality and wanted to change the idea of law from a set of rules that they were forced to obey, to law as including ideas of justice.<br />\nBy the end of the nineteenth century, the Indians started asserting themselves in the colonial courts. The Indian Legal profession began emerging as a force to reckon with and the Indians demanded respect in the courts. Indians started using law to defend their legal rights. Indian judges began to play a greater role in making decisions. Thus the Indians played a major role in the evolution of the rule of law during the colonial period.</p>\n",

It had a significant impact on the political situation of India, placing her on a path of political movement headed by Gandhi that ultimately dominated the Indian Independence movement for the next 20 years. The Act gave the Viceroy&#39;s government powers to quell sedition by silencing the press, detaining the political activists without trial, and arresting without warrant any individuals suspected of sedition or treason. In protest, a nationwide cessation of work was called, marking the beginning of widespread, although not nationwide, popular discontent.<br />\nThe agitation unleashed by the Act culminated on 13 April 1919, in the Jallianwala Bagh massacre in Amritsar, Punjab.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-10</strong><br />\nHow is a new law introduced in Parliament?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nParliament of India consists of the President and two Houses&mdash;the Council of States or the Rajya Sabha and the House of the People or the Lok Sabha.<br />\nA Bill can be introduced in either House of Parliament. A Bill introduced by the Minister is known as Government Bill and a Bill introduced by a private member is known as Private Member&#39;s Bill.<br />\nThe procedure for the passage of the Bills is similar in both the cases. A Bill has to pass through three stages in each House of Parliament and receive Presidential assent before it becomes an Act of Parliament. In the event of a deadlock between the two Houses on a Bill, the issue is resolved at a joint sitting of the two Houses.</p>\n"

Why do you think an independent judiciary is necessary to carry out this important function?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nThe independence of the judiciary allows the courts to play a central role in &lsquo;upholding the law and Enforcing Fundamental Rights&rsquo; as it ensures that there is no misuse of power by the legislature and the executive.

Legal procedures involve a lot of money and time. The poor who are illiterate and financially weak find it difficult going to court to get justice.<br />\nIn the 1980s the Supreme Court devised a mechanism of Public Interest Litigation or PIL to increase access to justice for the poor and illiterate. Any individual or organisation can file a PIL in the High Court or the Supreme Court on behalf of those whose rights are being violated. It is not necessary, that the person filing a case should have a direct interest in the case.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-6</strong><br />\nRe-read excerpts from the judgment on the Olga Tellis vs Bombay Municipal Corporation case. Now write in your own words what the judges meant when they said that the Right to Livelihood was part of the Right to Life.<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nOlga Tellis vs Bombay Municipal Corporation case portrays the plight of lakhs of persons who live on pavements and in slums in the city of Bombay. They constitute nearly half the population of the city.<br />\nThese men and women came to Court to ask for a judgment that they cannot be evicted from their shelters without being offered alternative accommodation. They rely for their rights on Article 21 of the Constitution which guarantees that no person shall be deprived of his life except according to procedure established by law.<br />\nThey do not contend that they have a right to live on the pavements. Their contention is that they have a right to live, a right which cannot be exercised without the means of livelihood. They have no option but to flock to big cities like Bombay, which provide the means of bare subsistence. They only choose a pavement or a slum which is nearest to their place of work.<br />\nTheir plea is that the right to life is misleading without a right to the protection of the means by which alone life can be lived.</p>\n",

This knowledge of forests made the Adivasis indispensable to the Rulers of the various Empires in India during the pre-colonial days.<br />\nAdivasis have their own languages which may be as old as Sanskrit. The Adivasi language has influenced the formation of Indian languages, like Bengali.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-7</strong><br />\nWould you agree with the statement that economic and social marginalisation are interlinked? Why?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nYes, economic and social marginalisation is interlinked. When Adivasis were displaced from their lands, they lost much more than a source of income. They lost their traditions and customs &ndash; a way of living and being. Destruction in one sphere impacts the other.</p>\n",

Marginalized groups are viewed with hostility and deprived of opportunities that are available to other communities. They experience a sense of disadvantage and powerlessness against more powerful and dominant sections of society.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-4</strong><br />\nWrite a brief note on Adivasis.<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nThe Adivasis are indigenous peoples and are believed to be the first inhabitants of India. Adivasis have distinct languages, religions and forms of self-government, together with a deep bond to their land and respect for nature. 8 per cent of India&rsquo;s population are Adivasis. There are over 500 different Adivasi groups in India.<br />\nAdivasi communities do not have any hierarchy among them. They are totally different from communities organised around principles of the caste system.<br />\nThe religion of Adivasis is different from Islam, Hinduism or Christianity. The Adivasis worship their ancestral, village or nature spirits.<br />\nDuring the nineteenth century, substantial numbers of Adivasis converted to Christianity, which has emerged as a very important religion in modern Adivasi history. Adivasis have their own languages which may be as old as Sanskrit. The Adivasi language has influenced the formation of Indian languages, like Bengali.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-5</strong><br />\nHow are Adivasis portrayed today?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nToday, Adivasis are portrayed as exotic, primitive and backward people. Cultural shows are presented with Adivasis dances. They are represented through colourful costumes and headgears.<br />\nAdivasis are blamed for their lack of advancement as they are believed to be resistant to change or new ideas.<br />\nThis negative portrayal of the Adivasis has led to the marginalization of this community in modern India.</p>\n",
                "<p><strong>Question-6</strong><br />\nWhat were the hardships faced by the Adivasis?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nThe Adivasis were pushed out of the forests of Jharkhand and they had to migrate to other parts of India and the world. The Adivasis experienced hardship and death during the migration. Five lakh Adivasis had perished in these migrations.<br />\nWhen forests were cleared for mining a majority of tribals are displaced. Wide areas of forest land were submerged under water when many dams were built in India after 1947. Due to this many Adivasis were displaced from the States of Andhra Pradesh, Chhattisgarh, Orissa and Jharkhand.<br />\nIn the North east, Adivasi lands are war-torn and occupied by the military.<br />\nThere are 54 national parks and 372 wildlife sanctuaries in India. These Parks cover an area of 1, 09,652 sq km. of forest land. The Adivasis were evicted from these forests.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-7</strong><br />\nWho headed the Committee set up by the government to look into the social, economic and educational status of the Muslim Community in India?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nJustice Rajindar Sachar headed the Committee set up by the government to look into the social, economic and educational status of the Muslim Community in India.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-8</strong><br />\nWhat was the conclusion reached by the Justice Rajindar Sachar Committee?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nThe committee came to the conclusion that on a range of social, economic and educational indicators the situation of the Muslim community is comparable to that of other marginalised communities like Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-9</strong><br />\nHow can we tackle marginalization?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nMarginalization is a complex and delicate issue and has to be handled by the Government very carefully. To rectify marginalization a variety of strategies, measures and safeguards have to be undertaken.<br />\nIt is the duty of every citizen of this country to ensure that the Fundamental Rights of all citizen, whether they belong to the majority community or the minority community is protected. It is only the effort of everyone that will protect the diversity that makes our country unique and promote equality for all.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-10</strong><br />\nWhat are the consequences of marginalisation?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nMarginalisation results in having a low social status and not having equal access to education and other resources enjoyed by the majority communities.</p>\n"

Now list one reason why you think he used this law to file a complaint.<br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong><br />\nRathnam used the 1989 Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act to file a complaint because on his refusal to perform a degrading ritual, the Dalit man was ostracized from his community, his hut set on fire and he was forced to move out of his village. These were all atrocities committed on a caste bias and humiliation forced down upon the Dalits.

Janu, believe that Adivasis can also use this 1989 Act to fight against dispossession? Is there anything specific in the provisions of the Act that allows her to believe this?<br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong><br />\nAdivasi activists including C.K. Janu believe that Adivasis can also use this 1989 Act to fight against dispossession because there is a specific provision in the Act for stating actions that dispossess Dalits and Adivasis of their modest resources or forcing them into performing slave labour, are criminal offences. Thus, the Act bears provisions to punish those who wrongfully occupy or cultivate any land allotted to or owned by a member of the Scheduled Castes or Scheduled Tribes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4:</strong><br />\nThe poems and the song in this Unit allow you to see the range of ways in which individuals and communities express their opinions, their anger and their sorrow.

                "<p><strong>Question-1</strong><br />\nWhy do you think there are so few cases of private water supply in the world?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nPrivate companies work for a profit. Providing public facilities like water supply is not a profitable business. More over the capital needed to provide water supply to the entire population is very high which very few private companies will be able to bear.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-2</strong><br />\nDo you think water in Chennai is available and affordable by all? Discuss.<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nWater is not equally available to all citizens in Chennai. Certain areas like Anna Nagar get copious water while areas like Saidapet receive very little water.<br />\nMunicipal supply meets only about half the needs of the people of the city, on an average. Areas that are close to the storage points get more water whereas colonies further away receive less water. The burden of shortfalls in water supply falls mostly on the poor.<br />\nThe middle class, when faced with water shortages, are able to cope through a variety of private means such as digging bore wells, buying water from tankers and using bottled water for drinking. The wealthy have safe drinking water, whereas the poor are again left out. In reality, universal access to &lsquo;sufficient and safe&rsquo; water, in Chennai, is still a dream.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-3</strong><br />\nHow is the sale of water by farmers to water dealers in Chennai affecting the local people? Do you think local people can object to such exploitation of ground water? Can the government do anything in this regard?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nMany private companies are providing water to cities due to shortage of water supply by the government organization. These companies buy water from places around the city.<br />\nIn Chennai, water is taken from nearby towns like Mamandur, Palur, Karungizhi and from villages to the north of the city using a fleet of over 13,000 water tankers. Every month the water dealers pay farmers an advance for the rights to exploit water sources on their land. The water that is taken away from the farms is creating a deficit for irrigation and for drinking water for the villagers. There is also a drastic drop in ground water levels in these areas.<br />\nThe local people have a right to object to this exploitation and the government has the power to stop this.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-4</strong><br />\nWhy are most of the private hospitals and private schools located in major cities and not in towns or rural areas?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nPrivate hospital and private schools are located only in major cities as the services they offer are very costly and only the affluent city dweller will be able to afford it.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-5</strong><br />\nDo you think the distribution of public facilities in our country is adequate and fair? Give an example of your own to explain.<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nThe distribution of public facilities in our country is neither adeduate no fair.for example, the Delhites avail all public facilities like water, healthcare and sanitation, electricity, public transport, schools and colleges. But if we go few kilometers away, for example, Mathura or Aligarh people face grave crises of public facilites. Electricity cut-off, water shorthages are normal routine of life. Public transport is also not properly developed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question-6</strong><br />\nPrivate educational institutions &ndash; schools, colleges, universities, technical and vocational training institutes are coming up in our country in a big way. On the other hand, educational institutes run by the government are becoming relatively less important. What do you think would be the impact of this? Discuss.<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nPrivate educational institutions levy very high fees, which only affluent people can afford. So quality education will be the right of only the rich. If educational institutions run by the government are not up to the mark, the weaker sections of the society are deprived of quality education.<br />\nThe end result of this disparity will be that only the rich will get good education while the poor will be deprived of it.</p>\n",

Farmers can run pump sets to irrigate their fields; people open small workshops that run on electricity.<br />\nPublic transport help people commute at an affordable price.

What is the problem with the periodisation of Indian history that James Mill offers?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;James Mill divided Indian history into three periods&mdash;Hindu, Muslim and British. This periodisation has its own problem. It is difficult to refer to any period of history as &lsquo;Hindu&rsquo; or &lsquo;Muslim&rsquo; because a variety of faiths existed simultaneously in these periods. It is also not justified to characterise an age through the religion of the rulers of the time. What it suggests is that the lives and practices of others do not really matter. It is worth-mentioning that even rulers in ancient India did not all share the same faith.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. Why did the British preserve official documents?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The British believed that by preserving official documents, it would be easier for them or any other persons to know about the decisions taken in the past. One can study the notes and reports that were prepared in the past. Their copies may be prepared and used in present time if needed so.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question&nbsp;4. How will the information historians get from old newspapers be different from that found in police reports?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The information printed in newspaper are usually affected by the views and opinions of the reporters, news editors etc. But what historians find in police reports are usually true and realistic.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5.

                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>SHORT ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. How did James Mill view India?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;James Mill did not cherish any positive idea about India. He was of the opinion that all Asian societies were at a lower level of civilisation than Europe. According to his telling of history, before the British came to India, the Hindu and the Muslim despots ruled the country. Religious intolerance, caste taboos and superstitious practices dominated social life. He felt that only British rule could civilise India. He suggested that the British should conquer all the territories of India to ensure the enlightenment and happiness of the Indian people. For India was not capable of progress without the help of the British.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. Historians divide Indian history into ancient, medieval and modem. But this division too has its problems. What are these problems?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;This periodisation has been borrowed from the West where the modem period was associated with the growth of dll the forces of modernity such as science, reason, democracy, liberty and equality. Medieval was a term used to describe a society where these features of modem society did not exist.<br />\nIt is difficult for us to accept this characterisation of the modem period. Here, it is worth-mentioning that Indians did not have equality, freedom or liberty under the British rule. The country also lacked economic growth and progress in that period. It is therefore many historians refer to modem period as colonial period.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. What did the British do to preserve important official documents and letters?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The British felt the need to preserve all the important official documents and letters. For this, they set up record rooms attached to all administrative institutions. The village tahsildar&rsquo;s office, the collectorate, the commissioner&rsquo;s office, the provincial secretariats, the lawcourts&mdash;all had their record rooms. The British also established specialised institutions such as archives and museums to preserve important records.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. What do official records not tell? How do we come to know about them?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Official records do not always help us understand what other people in the country felt, and what lay behind their actions. For that we have diaries of people, accounts of pilgrims and travellers, autobiographies of important personalities, and popular books, etc. that were sold in the local bazaars. With the spread of printing press, newspapers came to be published and issues began to be debated in public. Leaders and reformers wrote.to spread their ideas, poets and novelists wrote to express their feelings.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question: 5. How did the British conquer India and establish their rule?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The British conquered India in the following ways:<br />\n(a) They subjugated local nawabs and rajas.<br />\n(b) They established control over the economy and society collected revenue to meet all their expenses, bought goods they wanted at lower prices and produced crops they needed for export.<br />\n(c) They brought changes in rulers and tastes, customs and practices.<br />\n(d) Thus, they moulded everything in their favour and subjugated the country very soon.</p>\n",
                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question&nbsp;1. How do the official records of the British administration help historians to write about the last 250 years of Indian history?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The British believed that the act of writing was important. Hence, they got written up every instruction, plan, policy decision, agreement, investigation, etc. They thought that once this was done, things could be properly studied and debated. This conviction produced an administrative culture of mtemos, notings and reports.</p>\n\n<p>The British were very interested in preserving all important documents and letters. For this, they established record rooms attached to all administrative institutions such as the village tahsildar&rsquo;s office, the collectorate, law courts etc. They also set up archives and museums to preserve important records.</p>\n\n<p>Letters and memos that moved from one branch of the administration to smother in the early years of the 19th century can still be read in the archives. Historians can also take help from the notes and reports that district officials prepared or the instructions and directives that were sent by officials at the top to the provincial administrators.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. How did surveys become important under the colonial administration?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The British gave much importance to the practice of surveying because they believed that a country had to be properly known before it could be effectively administred. Therefore, they carried out detailed surveys by the early 19 th century in order to map the entire country:</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>They conducted revenue surveys in villages.</li>\n\t<li>They made efforts to know the topography, the soil quality, the flora, the fauna, the local histories and the cropping pattern.</li>\n\t<li>They also introduced census operations, held at the interval of every ten years from the end of the 19th century. They prepared detailed records of the number of people in all the provinces of India, noting information on castes, religions and occupation separately.</li>\n\t<li>The British also carried on several other surveys such as botanical surveys, zoological surveys, archeolo&not;gical surveys, forest surveys, etc. In this way, they gathered all the facts that were essential for administering a country.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>SOURCE-BASED QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1.

How did the assumption of Diwani benefit the East India Company?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Mughal emperor, in 1765, appointed the Company %s the Diwan of the provinces of Bengal. The Diwani allowed the Company to exploit the vast revenue resources of Bengal. This solved a major problem that the company had earlier faced. Although its trade had expanded, it had to buy most of the goods in India with gold and silver imported from Britain. The overflow of gold from Britain stopped after the assumption of Diwani. Now revenue from India could finance Company expenses. These revenues they used to purchase cotton and silk textiles in India, maintain Company troops and meet the cost of building the Company fort and offices at Calcutta.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 7.

                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>SHORT ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. Give an account of different European trading companies besides the British East India Company that entered the Eastern markets.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Different European trading companies were:<br />\n(a) <strong>The Portuguese:</strong>&nbsp;By the time the first English ships sailed down the West coast of Africa, round the Cape of Good Hope, and crossed the Indian Ocean, the Portuguese had already established their presence in the western coast of India and had their base in Goa.<br />\n(b) <strong>The Dutch:</strong>&nbsp;By the early 17th century, the Dutch too were exploring the possibilities of trade in the Indian Ocean.<br />\n(c) <strong>The French:</strong>&nbsp;The French traders soon arrived on the scene for the same purpose.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. What were the grievances of the Company regarding the Nawabs of Bengal?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Company declared that the unjust demands of the local officials were ruining the trade of the Company. Trade could flourish only if the duties were removed. It was also convinced that to expand trade it had to enlarge its settlements, buy up villages and rebuild its forts.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question&nbsp;3. Write a note on Tipu Sultan&mdash;The &lsquo;Tiger of Mysore&rsquo;.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Tipu Sultan was the famous ruler of Mysore. He ruled Mysore from 1782 to 1799. Under his leadership Mysore became very powerful. It controlled the profitable trade of the Malabar coast where the Company purchased pepper and cardamom. In 1785 Tipu Sultan stopped the export of these items through the ports of his kingdom, and disallowed local merchants from trading with the Company. He also developed relationship with the French in India to modernise his army with their help. The British got furious. They waged four battles against Tipu Sultan. The last battle proved unfortunate for him. He was killed depending his capital Seringapatam. The way he resisted the British is undoubtedly praiseworthy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. Give a brief description of all the three Anglo-Maratha wars. Also write the main consequences.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Company waged a series of wars against the Marathas in order to crush Maratha power:<br />\n(a) In the first war there was no clear victor, hence it ended in 1782 with the Treaty of Salbai.<br />\n(b) The second Anglo-Maratha War began in 1803 and ended in 1805. This war was fought on different fronts resulting in the British gaining Orissa and the territories north of the Yamuna river including Agra and Delhi.<br />\n(c) The third Anglo-Maratha War of 1817-1819 crushed Maratha power. The Peshwa was removed. The Company now had complete control over the territories south of the Vindhyas.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5. What administrative reformations were brought in the sphere of justice?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Before the reformations were brought, there were Maulvis and Hindu pandits who interpreted Indian laws for the European district collectors who presided over civil courts. The criminal courts were still under a qazi and a mufti. The Brahman pandits usually gave different interpretations of local laws. But there was no uniformity in them. To bring out about uniformity, in 1775 eleven pandits were asked to compile a digest of Hindu laws. N.B. Halhed translated this digest into English. By 1778 a code of Muslim laws was also compiled for the benefit of European judges, under the Regulating Act of 1773, a new Supreme Court was established, while a court of appeal&mdash;the Sadar Nizamal Adalat&mdash;was also set up at Calcutta.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. Give an account of the Battle of Plassey.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Company was very keen to have a puppet ruler in place of Sirajuddaulah, so that it might enjoy trade concessions and other privileges. It began to help one of Sirajuddaulah&rsquo;s rivals become the nawab. This infuriated Sirajuddaulah. He sternly asked the Company to stop meddling in the political affairs of his dominion. After negotiations failed, the Nawab marched with his soldiers to the English factory at Kasimbazar, captured the Company officials, disarmed all Englishmen and blocked English ships. Then he marched to Calcutta to establish control over the Company&rsquo;s fort there. As soon as the Company officials in Madras heard the news of the fall of Calcutta, they sent forces under the command of Robert Clive, reinforced by naval fleets. Prolonged negotiations with the Nawab followed. But no concrete solution came out. Finally, in 1759, Robert Clive led the Company&rsquo;s army against Sirajuddaulah at Plassey.<br />\nIn this battle, Sirajuddaulah got defeated. The main reason was that one of his commanders, Mir Jafar, did not fight the battle. He, in fact, supported the Company by not fighting because the Company had promised to make him Nawab after defeating Sirajuddaulah.<br />\nThe victory of the Company in the Battle of Plassey gave it immense confidence. It was the first major victory of the Company in India.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. Who introduced the policy of &lsquo;paramounty&rsquo;? What did it mean? What sort of resistance did the Company face?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Lord Hastings, who was the Governor- General of India from 1813 to 1823, introduced a new policy of &lsquo;paramounty&rsquo;. Now the Company claimed that its authority was paramount or supreme, hence its power was greater than that of Indian states. In order to protect its interests it was justified in annexing or threatening to annex any Indian kingdom.<br />\nHowever, this process did not go unchallenged. For example, when the British tried to annex, the small state of Kitoor (in Karnataka today), Rani Channamma took to arms and led an anti-British resistance movement. She was arrested in 1823 and died in prison in 1829. But this resistance movement did not stop. It was carried on by Rajana, a poor chowkidar of Sangoli in Kitoor. With popular support he destroyed many British camps and records. He was also caught and hanged by the British in 1830.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. How did the East India Company begin trade in Bengal?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The East India Company set up first English factory on the banks of the river Hugh in the year 1651. This became the base from which the Company&rsquo;s traders, known at that time as &lsquo;factors&rsquo;, operated. The factory had a warehouse where goods for export were stored and it had offices where Company officials set. As trade expanded, the Company persuaded merchants and traders to come and settle near the factory.<br />\nBy 1696 the Company began to build a fort around the settlement. Two years later it bribed Mughal officials into giving the Company zamindari rights over three villages. One of these was Kalikata which later developed into a city, known as Calcutta. The Company also persuaded the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb to issue a farman granting the Company the right to trade duty-free. The Company tried continuously to press for more concessions and manipulate existing privileges. For instance, Aurangzeb&rsquo;s farman had granted only the Company the right to trade duty-free. But Company officials who were carrying on private trade on the side, were expected to pay duty. But they refused to pay. This caused huge loss of revenue for Bengal.</p>\n",

Describe the main features of the Permanent Settlement.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The main features of the Permanent settlements were:<br />\n(i) The amount of revenue was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be increased in ever in future.<br />\n(ii) It was felt that this would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the Company&rsquo;s coffers and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land.<br />\n(iii) Since the revenue demand of the state would not be increased, the zamindar would benefit from increased production from the land.<br />\n(iv) Under this system revenue had been fixed so high that the zamindars found it difficult to pay.<br />\n(v) Even when the income of zamindars increased with the expansion of cultivation, the company had no chance of gain because it could not increase a revenue demand that had been fixed permanently.<br />\n(vi) The system proved oppressive for the cultivators.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. How was the Mahalwari System different from the permanent settlement?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>(i) Under the Permanent Settlement the rates of revenue was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be increased ever in future. But in Mahalwari System it was decided that the rate of revenue would be revised periodically, not permanently fixed.<br />\n(ii) Under the Permanent Settlement, the zamindars were given the charge of collecting revenue from the peasants and paying it to the Company. But in the Mahalwari System this charge was given to the village headmen.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5. Give two problems which arose with the new Munro system of fixing revenue.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Two problems:<br />\n(i) Revenue officials fixed a very high revenue demand and peasants were unable to pay it.<br />\n(ii) Ryots fled the countryside and villages became deserted in many regions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 6. Why were ryots reluctant to grow indigo?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The planters usually forced the ryots to sign a contract. Those who signed the contract got cash advances from the planters at low rates of interest to produce indigo. But the loan committed the ryot to cultivating indigo on at least 25% of the area under his holding. The planter provided the seed and the drill, while cultivators prepared the soil, sowed the seed and looked after the crop. When the crop was delivered to the planter after the harvest, the ryots got another new loan. In this way, they were trapped in the cycle of loan from which it was difficult to come out. Soon, they realised that this was a harsh system. They did hard labour day and night and got a very low price for the indigo they produced.<br />\nOther reason was that the planters usually pressurised the ryots to cultivate indigo on the best soils. But the ryots preferred to grow rice on these soils. Indigo had deep roots and it exhausted the soil rapidly. After an indigo harvest the land could not be used for rice cultivation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 7. What were the circumstances which led to the eventual collapse of indigo production in Bengal?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The ryots in Bengal got fed up with the coercive methods the planters used with them and finally refused to grow indigo. They became violent. They not only refused to pay rents to the planters, but also attacked indigo factories armed with swords and spears, bows and arrows. Meanwhile the local zamindars and village headmen also began to favour the indigo ryots. They mobililsed the indigo peasants and fought pitched battles with the lathiyals, the lathi- wielding strong men maintained by the planters. In other places even the zamindars went around villages urging the ryots to resist the planters. Worried by the rebellion, the government brought in the military to protect the planters from assault, and set up the Indigo commission to enquire into the system of indigo production. The commission held the planters guilty and criticised them for the coercive method they used with indigo cultivators. It declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots. The commission asked the ryots to fulfil their existing contracts but also told them that they could refuse to produce indigo in future. After this revolt, indigo production collapsed in Bengal.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 8.

                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>SHORT ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. How did the Bengal economy fall into a deep crisis?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;After the Company became the Diwan of Bengal it began its efforts to increase the revenue as much as it could and buy fine cotton and silk cloth as cheaply as possible. Within five years the value of goods bought by the Company in Bengal doubled. Before 1765, the Company had purchased goods in India by importing gold and silver from Britain. Now the revenue collected in Bengal could finance the purchase of goods for export. This caused huge loss of revenue for Bengal which paralysed its economy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. What were the consequences of the economic crisis that gripped Bengal?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The consequences of the economic crisis that gripped Bengal were as given below:<br />\n(a) Artisans began to leave villages since they were being forced to sell their goods to the Company at low prices.<br />\n(b) Peasants were unable to pay the dues that were being demanded from them.<br />\n(c) Artisanal production was in decline and agricultural cultivation showed signs of collapse.<br />\n(cf) The most terrible consequence came to be seen in 1770 when a terrible famine hit Bengal killing ten million people. About one- third of the population was wiped out.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. Give a brief description of the Mahalwari System.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Mahalwari System was devised by an Englishman called Holt Mackenzie which came into effect in 1822. He felt that the village was an important social institution in north Indian society that needed to be preserved. Under his directions collectors went from village to village inspecting the land, measuring the field and recording the customs and rights of different groups. The estimated revenue of each plot within a village was added up to calculate the revenue that each village, i.e. mahal had to pay. This demand was to be revised periodically. The village headman was given the charge of collecting the revenue and paying it to the Company.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. What was the Munro system? or what was Ryotwari system?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;In the British territories in the south a new system was devised that came to be known as the Ryotwari system. It was tried on a small-scale by Captain Alexander Read. Afterwards, Thomas Munro, who was the Governor of Madras, developed this system which gradually extended all over south India.<br />\nIn the south there were no traditional zamindars. Hence, the settlement was made directly with the cultivators or ryots who had tilled the land for generations. Their fields were separately surveyed before the revenue assessment was made.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5. By the end of the 18th century, the demand for Indian indigo grew further. What were the reasons behind it?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;This was the time when Britain began industrialise. As a result its cotton production expanded dramatically, creating an enormous new demand for cloth dyes. While the demand for indigo increased, its existing supplies from the West Indies and America collapsed. Between 1783 and 1789 the production of indigo in the world fell by half. Cloth dyers in Britain now began to look for new sources of indigo supply.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 6. How did indigo trade attract foreign traders?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Indigo trade flourished during the last decades of the 18th century. As a result commercial agents and officials of the Company began investing in indigo production. Over the years many Company officials left their jobs to look after their indigo business. Attracted by the prospect of high profits numerous Scotsmen and Englishmen came to India and became planters. Those who had no money to produce indigo could get loans from the Company and the banks that were coming up at that time.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 7. How was indigo cultivated under the ryoti system?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Under the ryoti system, the planters forced the lyots (cultivators) to sign a contract or an agreement also known as satta. At times they pressurised the village headmen to-sign the contract on behalf of the ryots. Those who sign the contract got cash advances from the planters at low rates of interest to produce indigo. But the loan committed the ryot to cultivating indigo on at least 25% of the area under his holding. The planter provided the seed and the drill, while the cultivators prepared the soil, sowed the seed and looked after the crop. When the crop was delivered to the planter after the harvest, a new loan was given to the ryot and the cycle started all over again.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 8. Why did the indigo cultivators decide to rebel? How did they show their anger?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The condition under which the indigo cultivators had to work was intensely oppressive. Finally they decided not to grow indigo. They became united and rebelled. They showed their anger in the following ways:<br />\n(a) They refused to pay rents to the planters, and attacked indigo factories armed with swords and spears, bows and arrows.<br />\n(b) Women turned up to fight with pots, pans and kitchen equipments.<br />\n(c) The Gomasthas, agents of planters, were beaten up, when they came collect rent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 9. Why was the Indigo Commission set up by the government? What were its findings and suggestions?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The government set up the Indigo Commission to enquire into the system of indigo production. The Commission held the planters guilty and criticised them for the coercive methods they used with indigo cultivators. It declared that indigo production was not profitable for ryots.<br />\nThe Commission asked the ryots to fulfil their existing contracts but also told them that they could refuse to grow indigo in future.</p>\n",
                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. What were the terms of the Permanent Settlement? What problems did it pose ?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;By the terms of the Permanent Settlement, the rajas and taluqdars were recognized as zamindars. They were asked to collect rent from the peasants and pay revenue to the Company. The amount to be paid was fixed permanently, that is, it was not to be increased ever in future.<br />\nBut this settlement created problems. The Company officials thought this would ensure a regular flow of revenue into the Company&rsquo; coffers and at the same time encourage the zamindars to invest in improving the land. But soon it was discovered that zamindars were not investing in the improvement of land. The revenue had been fixed so high that the zamindars found it difficult to pay. Anyone who failed to pay the revenue lost his zamindari.<br />\nBy the first decade of the 19th century, the prices in the market rose and cultivation slowly expanded. This meant an increase in the income of the zamindars but no gain for the Company since it had fixed the revenue demand permanently. Still the zamindars did not show interest in improving thq land.. In villages the system proved oppressive for the cultivators. The rent they paid to the zamindars was high and their right on the land was insecure. They had to take loan from the moneylenders in order to pay the rent. When they failed to pay the rent, they were evicted from the land they had cultivated for generations.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. What was nij cultivation? What were the problems with it?</strong><br />\n<strong>Or</strong><br />\n<strong>Why were planters reluctant to expand the area under nij cultivation till the late 19th century?&#39;</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Under nij cultivation, the planter produced indigo in lands that he directly controlled. He either bought the land or rented it from other zamindars and produced indigo by directly employing hired labourers. Nij cultivation had its drawbacks:<br />\n(a) The planters found it difficult to expand the area under nij cultivation. Indigo could be cultivated only on fertile lands and these were already densely populated. Hence, the planters attempted to lease in the land around the indigo factory and evict the peasants from the area. But this always led to conflicts and tension.<br />\n(b) Labour force was not easily available. A large plantation required a vast number of hands to operate. And labour was needed precisely at a time when peasants were usually busy with their rice cultivation.<br />\n(c) Nij cultivation on a large scale also required many ploughs and bullocks. Investing on purchase and maintenance of ploughs was a big problem. Nor could supplies be early got from the peasants since their ploughs and bullocks were busy on their rice fields, again exactly at the time that the indigo planters needed them.<br />\nThe planters were therefore reluctant to expand the area under nij cultivation till the late 19 th centuiy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. Describe different stages of the production of indigo.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;After the harvest, the indigo plant was taken to the vats in the indigo factory. Three or four vats were needed to manufacture the dye. Each vat had a separate function. The leaves stripped off the indigo plant were first soaked in warm water in a vat, also known as fermenting or steeper vat, for several hours. When the plants fermented, the liquid began to boil and bubble. Now the rotten leaves were taken out and the liquid drained into another vat that was placed just below the first vat.<br />\nIn the second vat, also known as the beater vat, the solution was continuously stirred and beaten with paddles. When the liquid gradually turned green and then blue, lime water was added to the vat. Gradually the indigo separated out in flakes, a muddy sediment settled at the bottom of the vat and a clear liquid rose to the surface. This liquid was drained off and the sediment, i.e. indigo pulp transferred to another vat, also known as the settling vat, and then pressed and dried for sale.</p>\n",

What problems did shifting cultivators face under British rule?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The life of shifting cultivators was directly connected to the forest. So, when the British brought changes in forest laws, their life was badly affected. The British extended their control over all forests and declared that forests were state property. Some forests were classified as Reserved Forests for they produced timber which the British wanted. In these forests people were not allowed to move freely and practise jhum cultivations. As a result, many jhum cultivators had to move to other areas in search of work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. How did the powers of tribal chiefs change under colonial rule?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The tribal chiefs were important people. They enjoyed a certain amount of economic power and had the right to administer and control their territories. Under the British rule, the functions and powers of these tribal chiefs changed to a great extent:<br />\n(i) They were allowed to keep their land titles over a cluster of villages and rent out lands, but they lost much of their administrative power and were forced to follow laws made by British officials in India.<br />\n(ii) They had to pay tribute to&#39; the British and discipline the tribal groups on behalf of the British.<br />\n(iii) They lost the authority they had earlier enjoyed amongst their people, and were unable to fulfil their traditional functions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5. What accounts for the anger of the tribals against the dikus?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The tribals wanted to drive out the dikus&mdash;missionaries, moneylenders, Hindu landlords, and the government because they saw them as the cause of their misery. The following facts account for their anger against the dikus:<br />\n(i) The land policies of the British were destroying their traditional land system.<br />\n(ii) Hindu landlords and moneylenders were taking over their land.<br />\n(iii) Missionaries were criticising their traditional culture.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 6. What was Birsa&rsquo;s vision of a golden age? Why do you think such a vision appealed to the people of the region?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Birsa was deeply influenced by many of the ideas he came in touch within his growing-up years. The movement that he led aimed at reforming tribal society. He urged the Munda to give up drinking liquor, clean their village, and stop believing in witchcraft and sorcery. He often remembered the gloden past of the Mundas, when they lived a good life, constructed embankments, tapped natural springs, planted trees and orchards, practised cultivation to earn their living. They did not kill their brethren and relatives. They lived honestly. Birsa wanted to restore this glorious past.<br />\nSuch a vision appealed to the people of the region because they were very much eager to lead a free life. They had got fed up with the colonial forest laws and the restrictions that were imposed on them.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 7.

                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>SHORT ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. What were the main activities of the Khonds living in the forests of Orissa?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Khonds were basically hunter- gatherers. They regularly went out on collective hunts and then divided the meat amongst themselves. They ate fruits and roots collected from the forest and cooked food with the oil they extracted from the seeds of the sal and mahua. They used many forest shrubs and herbs for medicinal purposes and sold forest produce in the local markets. All their activities were based on forest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. How did traders and moneylenders exploit the tribal people?</strong><br />\n<strong>Or</strong><br />\n<strong>How were traders and moneylenders cause of the tribals&rsquo; misery? [V. Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Tribal groups often needed to buy and sell in order to be able to get the goods that were not produced within the locality. This led to their dependence on traders and moneylenders. Traders came around with things for sale. They sold the goods at high prices.<br />\nMoneylenders used to give loans with which the tribals met their cash needs, adding to what they earned. But the interest charged on the loans was very high. Thus, both traders and moneylenders always exploited the tribal people. It is therefore the tribals- saw them as evil outsiders and the cause of their misery.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. How did the British officials view settled tribal groups and those who moved about from place to place?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The British officials saw settled tribal groups such as the Gonds and Santhals as more civilised than hunter-gatherers or shifting cultivators. These tribal groups lived in the forests and kept on moving. They did not have a fixed home. The British considered them wild and savage and therefore they needed to be settled and civilised.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. Describe land settlements introduced by the British.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The British introduced land settlements to ensure a regular revenue source for the state. Under these settlements:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>the British measured the land, defined the rights of each individual to that land, and fixed the revenue demand for the state.</li>\n\t<li>some peasants were declared landowners, others tenants. The tenants were to pay rent to the landowner who in turn paid revenue to the state.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5. Why was the British effort to settle jhum cultivators not very successful?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>(a) It is usually difficult to carry on settled plough cultivation in areas where water is scarce and the soil is dry.<br />\n(b) Jhum cultivators who took to plough cultivation often suffered since their fields did not prdfcluce good yields. Hence, the jhum cultivators in north-east India insisted on continuing with their traditional practice.<br />\n(c) The British faced widespread protests. Therefore, they allowed them to carry on shifting cultivation in some parts of the forest.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 6. What problem did the British face after they brought changes in forest laws? How did they solve this problem?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The British stopped the tribal people from living inside forests by introducing some changes in forest laws. This created a problem. They lost labour force because most of the jhum cultivators moved to other areas in search of work. Who would cut trees for railway sleepers and transport logs?<br />\nColonial officials solved this problem by giving jhum cultivators small patches of land in the forests and allowing them to cultivate these on the condition that these who lived in villages would have to provide labour to the Forest Department and look after the forests. The Forest Department established forest villages in many regions to ensure a regular supply of cheap labour.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 7. Give a brief history of the revolts by different tribal groups in the country.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Several tribal groups in different parts of the country were unhappy with the changes they were experiencing and the problems they were facing under the British rule. Finally, they rebelled against the changes in laws, the restrictions on their practices, the new taxes they had to pay, and the exploitation by traders and moneylenders.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>The Kols rebelled in 1831-32.</li>\n\t<li>The Santhals rose in revolt in 1855.</li>\n\t<li>The Bastar Rebellion in central India broke out in 1910.</li>\n\t<li>The Warli Revolt in Maharashtra in 1940.</li>\n\t<li>Birsa Munda also led one such movement.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Question 8. How did Birsa resume his movement after his release in 1897?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Birsa was released in 1897. Now he began touring the villages to gather support. He used traditional symbols and language to rouse people, urging them to destroy dikus and the Europeans and establish a kingdom under his leadership. Birsa&rsquo;s followers began targetting the symbols of dikus and European power. They attacked police stations and churches and raided the property of moneylenders and zamindars. They raised the white flag as a symbol of Birsa Raj.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 9. In what ways was the Birsa movement significant?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Birsa movement was significant in two ways:<br />\n(a) It forced the colonial government to introduce laws so that the land of the tribals could not easily be taken over by dikus.<br />\n(b) It showed once again that the tribal people had the capacity to protest against injustice and express their anger against colonial rule. They did this in their own specific way, inventing their own rituals and symbols of struggle.</p>\n",
                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question&nbsp;1. How did different tribal groups live? Describe in brief.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Tribal people were involved in many different types of activities:<br />\n(a) Some tribal people practised jhum cultivation also known as shifting cultivation. This was done on small patches of land, mostly in forests. The cultivators cleared off small patches of land. They then burnt the vegetation and spread the ash from the firing, which contained potash to fertilise the soiir They used equipments like axe and hoe for preparing the soil for cultivation. Then they scattered the seeds on the field. Once the crop was ready, and harvested, they moved to another field. Shifting cultivators were found in the hilly and forested tracts of north-east and central India.</p>\n\n<p>(b) Some tribal groups were engaged in hunting animals and gathering forest produce, hence known as &ldquo;hunter-gatherers&rsquo;. They saw forests as essential for survival. The Khonds were such a community living in the forests of Orissa. They regularly went out on collective hunts and then divided the meat amongst themselves. They ate fruits and roots and cooked food with the oil they extracted from the seeds of the sal and mahua. They got rice and other grains in return for their valuable forest produce. Sometimes they did odd jobs in the villages like carrying loads, etc.</p>\n\n<p>(c) Some tribal groups lived by herding and rearing animals. They were pastoralists who moved with their herds of cattle or sheep according to the seasons. For examples, the Vicm Gujjars of Punjab hills, and the Labadis of Andhra Pradesh were cattle herders, the Gaddis of Kulu were shepherds and the Bakarwals of Kashmir reared goats.</p>\n\n<p>(d) Some tribal community took to settled cultivation. They cultivated their fields in one place year after year, instead of moving from place to place. They began to use the plough and gradually got rights over the land they lived on.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question&nbsp;2. Give a brief life sketch of Birsa Munda.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>Birsa was bom in the mid-1870s in a family of Mundas, a tribal group that lived in Chottanagpur. He grew up around the forests of Bohanda, grazing sheep, playing flute and dancing in the local akharas. As an adolescent Birsa heard tales of the Munda uprisings of the past and saw sirdars (leaders) of the community urging the people to revolt.</li>\n\t<li>Birsa took great interest in the sermons of missionaries because they inspired the Mundas to attain their lost rights. He also enjoyed the company of a prominent Vaishnav preacher. He wore the sacred thread and began to value the importance of purity and piety.</li>\n\t<li>He decided to reform tribal society. He urged the Mundas to give up all their bad practices like drinking liquor, etc. Here, it is worth-mentioning that Birsa also turned against missionaries and Hindu landlords.</li>\n\t<li>He urged his followers to restore their glorious past. He talked of a golden age in the past&mdash;when Mundas lived a very good life. They did not kill their brethren and relatives. Birsa wanted to see these qualities again in the tribal society.</li>\n\t<li>The British officials got terrified to visualise the political aims of Birsa Munda. As the movement spread, the government arrested him in 1895, convicted him on the charges of rioting. He was also jailed him for two years.</li>\n\t<li>After Birsa was released in 1897, he began to tour the villages to gather support. He urged his supporters to destroy dikus and the Europeans. In 1900, he died of cholera and the movement faded out. But it proved significant in the long run.</li>\n</ul>\n",

                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question&nbsp;1. How did other Indian soldiers in Meerut participate in the Revolt of 1857? How did the regiments stationed in Delhi respond when they came to know about the arrival of the Meerut sepoys in the city?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The other Indian soldiers in Meerut participated in the uprising wholeheartedly. On 10 May, 1857 they marched to the jail in Meerut and released the sepoys who were sentenced to ten years&rsquo; jail for disobeying their officers. They attacked and killed British officers. They captured guns and ammunition and set fire to the buildings and properties of the British and declared war on the firangis. The soldiers were determined to bring an end to the British rule in the country.<br />\nThe sepoys of Meerut rushgd to Delhi in the early hours on 11 May. As news of their arrival spread, the regiments stationed in Delhi also rose up in rebellion. Again British officers were killed, arms and ammunition were seized, buildings were set on fire. Triumphant soldiers gathered around the walls of the Red Fort where the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar lived, demanding to meet him. The emperor was not willing to challenge the mighty British power but the soldiers persisted. They forced their way into the palace and proclaimed Bahadur Shah Zafar as their leaders. The emperor finally accepted this demand. After getting the leader, the soldiers began to plan for further action.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. How did the rebellion spread to other regions of the country?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The position of the British became very weak in Delhi and they were almost defeated by the rebel force. Therefore, there was no uprising for almost a week. Afterwards a spurt of mutinies began in several parts of India. Regiment after regiment mutinied and took to join otlter troops at nodal points like Delhi, Kanpur and Lucknow. After them, the people of the towns and villages also&quot; rose up in rebellion. They rallied around local leaders, zamindars and chiefs who were prepared to establish their authority and fight the British.<br />\nNana Saheb, the adopted son of the late Peshwa Baji Rao who lived near Kanpur, gathered armed forces and expelled the British Garrison from the city. He proclaimed himself Peshwa. He delcared that he was a Governor under emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. In Lucknow, Birjis Qadr, the son of the deposed Nawab Wajid Ali Shah, was proclaimed the new Nawab. He too acknowledged the suzerainty of Bahadur Shah Zafar.<br />\nIn Jhansi, Rani Lakshmibai joined the rebel sepoys and fought the British along with Tantia Tope, the General of Nana Saheb.<br />\nA situation of widespread rebellion also developed in the region of Awadh. Many new leaders also came up and joined the revolt. Ahmadullah Shah, a maulvi from Faizabad, raised a large force of supporters. He came to Lucknow to fight the British.<br />\nIn Delhi, a large number of religious warriors came together to wipe out the white people. Bakht Khan, a soldier from Bareilly, took charge of a large force of fighters who came to Delhi. In Bihar, an old zamindar, Kunwar Singh, joined the rebel sepoys and battled with the British for several months.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. How did the Company suppress the revolt?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Company did not get nervous to sea the strength of the rebel forces. Instead, it decided to suppress the revolt with all its might. It brought reinforcements from England, passed new laws so that the rebels could be convicted with ease, and then moved into the storm centres of the revolt. Delhi was recaptured from the rebel forces in September 1857. The last Mughal emperor, Bahadur Shah Zafar was tried in court and sentenced to life imprisonment. He and his wife were sent to prison in Rangoon in October 1858.<br />\nThe recapture of Delhi did not mean that the rebellion died down completely. People continued to resist and battle the British. So, the British had to fight for two years to suppress the massive forces of popular rebellion.<br />\nThe British took Lucknow in 1858. Rani Lakshmibai was defeated and killed in June 1858. Tantia Tope, who fought a guerrilla war, was finally captured, tried and killed in April 1859.</p>\n",

Identify three differences in the city design of New Delhi and Shahjahanabad.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Three differences were:<br />\n(i) Shahjahanabad was crowded with mohallas, and several dozen bazaars. But New Delhi was not crowded nor were there mazes of narrow by-lanes.<br />\n(ii) Shahjahanabad was not established in a planned manner while New Delhi was beautifully planned.<br />\n(iii) There was chaos everywhere in Shahjahanabad. But New Delhi represented a sense of law and order. &rsquo;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. Who lived in the &lsquo;white&rsquo; areas in cities such as Madras?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The British lived in the &lsquo;white&rsquo; areas in cities such as Madras.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5. What is meant by de-urbanisation?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;De-urbanisation is a process by which more and more people began to live in villages or rural areas.<br />\nIn the late 18th century, Calcutta, Bombay and Madras emerged as Presidency cities. They became the centres of British power in different regions of India. At the same time, several smaller cities declined. Old trading centres and ports could not survive when the flow of trade shifted to new centres. Similarly, earlier centres of regional power collapsed with the defeat of local rurals by the British and new centres of administration grew. This process is described as de-urbanisation.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 6. Why did the British choose to hold a grand Durbar in Delhi although it was not a capital?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;During the Revolt of 1857, the British had realised that the Mughal emperor was still important to the people and they saw him as their leader. It was therefore important to celebrate British power with pomp and show in Delhi&mdash; the city the Mughal emperors had ruled earlier. The British thought that by doing this they would acknowledge people about their power and authority.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 7. How did the Old City of Delhi change under British rule?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The British changed the Old City of Delhi entirely. They wanted Delhi to forget its Mughal past. Hence, the area around the Fort was completely cleared of gardens, pavilions and mosques. They either destroyed, the mosques or put them to other uses. For example, the Zinat-al-Masjid was converted into a bakery. No worship was allowed in the Jama Masjid for five years.<br />\nOne-third of the city was demolished and its canals were filled up.<br />\nIn the 1870s, the western walls of Shahjahanabad were broken to establish the railway and to allow the city to expand beyond the walls. The British began living in the sprawling Civil Lines area that came up in the north, away from the Indians in the Walled City.<br />\nThe Delhi College was turned into a school and shut down in 1877.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 8. How did the partition affect life in Delhi?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;India got partitioned in 1947 and this led to a massive transfer of populations on both sides of the new border. As a result, the population of Delhi increased all of a sudden. The job of the people changed and the culture of the city became different. Most of these migrants were from Punjab. They stayed in camps, schools, etc. While some got the opportunity to occupy residences that had been vacated by the Muslims. Yet others were housed in refugee colonies. New colonies like Lajpat Nagar and Tilak Nagar grew at this time. Shops and stalls were set up to cater the needs of the migrants, schools and colleges were opened. The migrants coming to Delhi were rural landlords, lawyers, teachers, traders and small shopkeepers. Partition changed their lives and occupations. They had tp take up new jobs like hawkers, vendors, carpenters, and ironsmiths.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 9. Find out the history of the town you live in or of any town nearby. Check when and how it grew, and how it has changed over the years. You could look at the history of the bazaars, the buildings, cultural institutions, and settlements.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;Attempt yourself.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 10. Make a list of at least ten occupations in the city, town or village to which you belong, and find out how long they have existed. What does this tell you about the changes within this area?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;I live in a village, I find here the following occupations in which villagers are engaged:<br />\n(i) Farming&nbsp;<br />\n(ii) Fishing<br />\n(iii) Teaching&nbsp;<br />\n(iv) Carpentry<br />\n(v) Grocery&nbsp;<br />\n(vi) Vending<br />\n(vii) Weaving&nbsp;<br />\n(viii) Cattle rearing<br />\n(ix) Blacksmith&nbsp;<br />\n(x) Barber These occupations have existed from a long time in the village. We have seen many changes in the methods of these occupations. With spread of education and awareness, many new technologies have been adopted. For example, in the beginning farmers used ploughs in their fields but now they are using tractors.</p>\n",

Describe the main features of Shahjahanabad, built by Shah Jahan.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Main features are given below:<br />\n(a) Shahjahanabad, that was began in 1639, consisted of a fort-palace complex and the city adjoining it. Lai QUa or the Red Fort contained the palace complex.<br />\n(b) To its west lay the Walled City with 14 gates.<br />\n(c) The main streets of Chandni Chowk and Faiz Bazaar were broad enough for royal processions to pass. A canal ran down the centre of Chandni Chowk.<br />\n(d) The Jama Masjid was among the largest and grandest mosques in India. There was no place higher than this mosque within the city.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. Before 1857, developments in Delhi were somewhat different from those in other colonial cities. How?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;In Presidency cities, Bombay, Madras and Calcutta, the living spaces of Indians and the British were sharply separated. Indians lived in the &ldquo;black&rsquo; areas, while the British lived in well laid out &ldquo;white&rsquo; areas. But in Delhi, in the first half of the 19th century, the British lived alongwith the wealthier Indians in the Walled City. The British learned to enjoy Urdu/Persian culture and poetry and took part in local festivals.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. What happened to Delhi after 1857?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;During the Revolt of 1857, the rebels gathered in the Delhi and captured it under the leadership of the Mughal emperor Bahadur Shah Zafar. Delhi remained under the control of the rebels for four months.<br />\nWhen the British recaptured Delhi, they embarked on a campaign of revenge and plunder. The British forces began wrecking vengeance on the streets of Delhi, massacring the rebels. To prevent another rebellion, the British exiled Bahadur Shah to Burma, dismantled his court, razed several of the places, closed down gardens and built barracks for troops in their place.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. How did partition change the lives and occupations of the refugees? [Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The partition caused massive transfer of populations on both sides of the new border. Muslims left Delhi for Pakistan while their place was taken by equally large numbers of Sikh and Hindu refugees from Pakistan. Many of the Muslims who went to Pakistan were artisans, petty traders and labourers. The new migrants coming to Delhi were rural landlords, lawyers, teachers, traders and small shopkeepers. Partition changed their lives and their occupation. They had to take up new jobs as hawkers, vendors, carpenters and ironsmiths.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5. Write a short note on &lsquo;havelis&rsquo;.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Havelis were grand mansions in which the Mughal aristocracy in the 17th and 18th centuries lived.<br />\nA haveli housed many families. On entering the haveli through a beautiful gateway, there was an open courtyard which was surrounded by public rooms. These public rooms meant for visitors and business, used exclusively by males. The inner courtyard with its pavilions and rooms was meant for the women of the household. Rooms in the havelis had multiple uses, and very little by way of furniture.<br />\nThese havelis began to decline as the Mughal amirs found it difficult to maintain them under conditions of British rule.<br />\nSome havelis were subdivided and sold. Some were taken over by the upcoming mercantile class while many feel into decay.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 6. Describe the main features of the colonial bungalow.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The main features of the colonial bungalow:<br />\n(a) It was meant for one nuclear family.<br />\n(b) It was a large single-storyed structure with a pitched roof and usually set in one or two acres of open ground.<br />\n(c) It had separate living and dinning rooms and bedrooms and a wide verandah running in the fronts and sometimes on three sides.<br />\n(d) Kitchens, stables and servants&rsquo; quarters were in a separate space from the main house. The house was run by dozens of servants.</p>\n",
                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. Discuss the construction plan of New Delhi.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;New Delhi was constructed as a 10-square-mile city on Raisina Hill, south of the existing city. Two architects namely Edward Lutyens and Herbert Baker, were called on to design New Delhi and its buildings. The government complex in New Delhi consisted of two-mile avenue, Kingsway, now known as Rajpath, led to the Viceroy&rsquo;s Palace, now known as Rashtrapati Bhavan, with the Secretariat buildings on either sides of the avenue.</p>\n\n<p>The features of these government buildings were borrowed from different periods of India&rsquo;s imperial history, but the overall look was classical Greece of Fifth century BCE. For instance, the central dome of the Viceroy&rsquo;s Palace was copied from the Buddhist stupa at Sanchi, and the red sandstone and carved screens or Jalis were borrowed from Mughal architecture.<br />\nThese new buildings, had to assert British importance. Therefore, the Viceroy&rsquo;s Palace was kept higher than Shah Jahan&rsquo;s Jama Masjid.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. What did the Census of 1931 reveal? What attempts were made to decongest the old city?&nbsp;</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Census of 1931 revealed that the Walled City area was densely populated with as many as 90 persons per acre, while New Delhi had only about 10 persons per acre.</p>\n\n<p>Several attempts were made to decongest the the old city, for example, in 1888 an extension scheme called the Lahore Gate Improvement Scheme was planned by Robert Clarke for the Walled City residents. The idea was to draw residents away from the old city to a new type of market square, around which shops would be built. Streets in this redevelopment strictly followed the grid pattern and were of identical width, size and character. Land was devided into regular areas for the construction of neighbourhoods. But this development remained incomplete and did not help to decongest the old city.<br />\nIn 1936, the Delhi Improvement Trust was set up. It built areas like Daiyaganj south for wealthy Indians. Houses were grouped around parks. Within the houses, space was divided according to new rules of privacy. Instead of spaces being shared by many families or groups, now different members of the same family had their own private spaces within the home.</p>\n",

What kinds of cloth had a large market in Europe?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Chintz, cossaes or khassa and bandanna.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. What is jamdani?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Jamdani is a fine muslin on which decorative motifs are woven on the loom, typically in grey and white.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. What is bandanna?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Bandanna is a brightly coloured and printed scarf for the neck or head. Originally, the term derived from the word &lsquo;bandhna&rsquo; and referred to a variety of brightly coloured cloth produced through a method of tying and dying.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. Who are the Agarias?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Groups of men and women carrying basket-loads of iron are known as the Agarias.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5. Fill in the blanks:</strong><br />\n<strong>(a) The word chintz comes from the word</strong><br />\n<strong>(b) Tipu&rsquo;s sword was made of steel.</strong><br />\n<strong>(c) India&rsquo;s textile exports declined in the century.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;<br />\n(a) chintz&nbsp;<br />\n(b) Wootz&nbsp;<br />\n(c) 19th.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 6. How do the names of different textiles tell us about their history?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;European traders first saw fine cotton cloth from India carried by Arab merchants in Mosul in present-day Iraq. Hence, they began to refer to all finally woven textiles as muslino. When the Portuguese first came to India in search of spices, they landed in Calicut on the Kerala coast in south-west India. The cotton textiles which they took back to Europe came to be known as calico, which is derived from Calicut.<br />\nPrinted cotton cloths called chintz, cossaes or khassa and bandanna were also in great demand. The chintz is derived from the Hindi word chhint, a cloth with small and colourful flowery designs. The word bandanna is referred to any brightly coloured and printed scarf for the neck or head. Originally, the term derived from the word &lsquo;bandhna&rsquo; (Hindi for tying) and referred to a variety of brightly coloured cloth produced through a method of tying and dying.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 7. Why did the wool and silk producers in England protest against the import of Indian textiles in the early eighteenth century?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Textile industry had just begun to develop in England in the early 18th century. The wool and silk producers in England found themselves unable to compete with Indian textiles. They wanted to secure market within the country by preventing the entry of Indian textiles. Therefore, they protested against its import.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 8. How did the development of cotton industries in Britain affect textile producers in India?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The development of cotton industries in Britain badly affected textile producers in India:<br />\n(1) Indian textiles now had to compete with British textiles in the European and American markets.<br />\n(ii) Exporting textiles to England became increasingly difficult since very high duties were imposed on Indian textiles imported into Britain,<br />\n(iii) Thousands of weavers in India became unemployed. Bengal weavers were the worst hit.<br />\n(iv) By the 1830s British cotton cloth flooded Indian markets. This affected not only specialist weavers but also spinners.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 9. Why did the Indian iron smelting industry decline in the nineteenth century?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;There were several reasons:<br />\n(i) The new forest laws of the colonial government prevented people from entering the reserved forests. Now it became difficult for the iron smelters to find wood for charcoal. Getting iron ore was also a big problem. Hence, many gave up their craft and looked for other jobs.<br />\n(ii) In some areas the government did grant access to the forest. But the iron smelters had to pay a very high tax to the forest department for every furnace they used. This reduced their income.<br />\n(iii) By the late 19th century iron and steel was being imported from Britain. Ironsmiths in India began using the imported iron to manufacture utensils and implements. This inevitably lowered the demand for iron produced by local smelters.<br />\nAll these reasons caused the decline of the Indian iron smelting industry.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 10. What problems did the Indian textile industry face in the early years of its development?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;In the early years of its development the Indian textile industry faced several problems:<br />\n(i) It found it difficult to compete with the cheap textiles imported from Britain.<br />\n(ii) In most countries, governments supported industrialisation by imposing heavy duties on imports. This eliminated competition and protected newly born industries. But the colonial government in India refused such protection to local industries. However, during the First World War when textile imports from Britain declined Indian factories were called upon to produce cloth for military supplies. This boosted up cotton factory production in India.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 11. What helped TISCO expand steel production durinq the First World War?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Before the First World War India imported British steel for rails. When in 1914 the war broke out, steel produced in Britain now had to meet the demands of war in Europe. So, imports &lsquo;of British steel into India declined and the Indian Railways turned to TISCO for supply of rails. As the war dragged on for several years, TISCO had to produce shells and carriage wheels for the war. By 1919 the colonial government was buying 90% of the steel manufactured by TISCO. Over time TISCO became the biggest steel industry within the British empire.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 12. Find out about the history of any craft around the area you live.

                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>SHORT ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. How were Indian textiles viewed in the world market?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;India was the largest producer of cotton textiles in the world before the British conquered Bengal around 1750. Indian textiles had long been renowned both for their fine quality and exquisite craftsmanship. They were extensively traded in Southeast Asia (Java, Sumatra and Penang) and West and Central Asia. From the 16th century European trading companies began buying Indian textiles for sale in Europe.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. How did the inventions of Spinning Jenny and Steam Engine revolutionise cotton textile weaving in England?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Textile industries had just emerged in England in the early 18th century.<br />\nSo, it was difficult for the English producers to compete with Indian textiles. This competition with Indian textiles led to a search for technological innovation in England. In 1764, the Spinning Jenny was invented by John Kaye which increased the productivity of the traditional spindles.<br />\nThen came the steam engine. It was invented by Richard Arkwright in 1786. These two inventions revolutionised cotton textile weaving in England. Cloth could now be woven in immense quantities and cheaply too.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. Give a description of the four regions where textile production was concentrated in the early 19th century.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Textile production was concentrated in the following four regions in the early 19th century:<br />\n(a) Bengal was one of the most important centres. Located along the numerous rivers in the delta, the production centres in Bengal could easily transport goods to distant places.<br />\n(b) Dacca in Eastern Bengal, present- day Bangladesh, was the foremost textile centre in the 18th century. It was famous for its mulmut and jamdani weaving.<br />\n(c) Textile production was concentrated along the Coromandal coast stretching from Madras to nothem Andhra Pradesh.<br />\n(d) On the western coast there were important weaving centres in Gujarat.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. Who were the weavers? Name some communities famous for weaving.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Weavers often belonged to communities that specialised in weaving. Their skills were passed on from one generation to the next.<br />\nList of some communities famous for weaving includes:<br />\n(a) the tanti weavers of Bengal.<br />\n(b) the julahas or momin weavers of north India.<br />\n(c) sale and kaikollar and devangs of South India.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5. Describe the process of cloth making.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The process of cloth making consists of two stages:</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>The first stage of production was spinning, Le. work done mostly by women. The charkha and the takli were household spinning instruments. The thread was spun on the charkha and rolled on the takli.</li>\n\t<li>When the spinning was over the thread was woven into cloth by the weaver.</li>\n\t<li>In most communities weaving was a task done by men. For coloured textiles, the thread was dyed by the dyer, called rangrez. For painted cloth the weavers needed the help of specialist block printers called chhipigars.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>Question 6. Handloomproduction did not completely die in India. Why?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;This was because some types of cloths could not be supplied by machines. Just take the examples of saris with intricate borders and cloths with traditional woven patterns. Machines could not produce them. These had a wide demand not only amongst the rich but also amongst the middle classes. Moreover, the textile manufacturers in Britain could not produce the very coarse cloths used by the poor people in India.<br />\nIn the late 19th century, Sholapur and Madurai grew as important new centres of weaving. During the national movement, Gandhiji urged people to use hand-spun and handwoven cloth Khadi which gradually became a symbol of nationalism.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 7. Give a brief description of growth of cotton mills in India.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The first cotton mill in India was set up as a spinning mill in Bombay in 1854. By 1900, over 84 mills started operating in Bombay.<br />\nMills were set up in other cities too. The first mill in Ahmedabad was started in 1861. A year later a mill was established in Kanpur, in the United Provinces. Growth of cotton mills led to a demand for labour. As a result, thousands of poor peasants, artisans and agricultural labourers moved to cities to work in the mills.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 8. Who are the Agarias? Why did they leave their village?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Agarias are a community of iron smelters. They are specialised in the craft of iron smelting.<br />\nIn the late 19th century a series of famines devastated the dry tracts of India. In central India, many of the Agaria iron smelters stopped work, deserted their villages and migrated, looking for some other work to survive the hard times. A large number of them never worked their furnaces again.</p>\n",

Write a few lines on each of the following:</strong><br />\n<strong>(a) Patola weave (b) Jamdani weave (c) Chintz</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong><br />\n(a) <strong>Patola weave.</strong> It came into existence in the mid-19th century. It was woven in Surat, Ahmedabad and Patan. It was highly valued in Indonesia. It became a part of the local weaving tradition there.<br />\n(b) <strong>Jamdani weave.</strong> It grew in the early 20th century. Jamdani is a fine muslin on which decorative motifs are woven on the loom, typically in grey and white. Often a mixture of cotton and gold thread was used. The most important centres of jamdani weaving were Dacca in Bengal and Lucknow in the United Provinces.<br />\n(c)<strong> Chintz. </strong>The term chintz is derived from the Hindi word chhint, a cloth with small and colourful flowery designs. It was produced in Masulipatnam and Andhra Pradesh in the mid-19th century. It was in great demand in England and Europe.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. How did Iron and Steel factories come up in India?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Jamsetji Tata had decided to spend a large part of his fortune to build a big iron and steel industry in India. But this could not be done without identifying the sources of fine quality iron ore. For this reason his son, Dorabji Tata along with Charles Weld, an American geologist, began travelling in Chhattisgarh in search of iron ore deposits. It was the year 1904.One day, after travelling for many hours in the forests, Weld and Dorabji came upon a small village where they met the Agarias, who were carrying basket loads of iron ore. When asked where they had found the iron ore, the Agarias pointed to hill in the distance, Weld and Dorabji rushed to the hill. On exploring the hill the geologist declared that they had at last found what they had been looking for.</p>\n\n<p>But there was a problem. The region was dry and the Tatas had to search for a more suitable place to set up their factory.<br />\nA few years later a large area of forest was cleared on the banks of the river Subarnarekha to set up the factory and an industrial township, i.e. Jamshedpur. Here, there was water near iron ore deposits. The Tata Iron and Steel Company, popularly known as TISCO began producing steel in 1912.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>SOURCE-BASED QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1.

                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>SHORT ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. Why did many Company officials in India want to promote Indian rather than Western learning?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Many Company officials felt that institutions should be set up to encourage the study of ancient Indian texts and teach Sanskrit and Persian literature and poetry. These officials were of the opinion that Hindus and Muslims ought to be taught what they were already familiar with and what they valued and preserved, not subjects that were alien to them. They believed that only by doing this the British could win the hearts of the Indians, only then they could expect to be respected by their subjects.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. What were the views of other Company officials?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Other Company officials did not approve the ideas of the Orientalists. They began to criticise the Orientalist- vision of learning. They saved that the knowledge of the East was full of errors and unscientific thought. They saw Eastern literature as non-serious and light-hearted. So, they argued that it was wrong on the part of the British to spend so much effort in encouraging the study of Arabic and Sanskrit language and literature.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. Define the term &lsquo;vernacular&rsquo;. Why did the British use this term in colonial countries like India?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The term Vernacular&rsquo; refers to a local language or dialect as distinct from what is known as the standard language.<br />\nIn colonial countries like India, the British used this term to mark the difference between the local languages of everyday use and English, the language of the imperial masters.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. What measures were taken by the English Education Act of 1835?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The following measures were taken under the English Education Act 1835:<br />\n(a) English was made the medium of instruction for higher education.<br />\n(b) Promotion of Oriental institutiohs like the Calcutta Madrasa and Benaras Sanskrit College was stopped. These institutions were seen as temples of darkness that were falling of themselves into decay.<br />\n(c) English textbooks began to be produced for schools.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5. What measures were taken by the British after issuing of Wood&rsquo;s Despatch?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Following measures were taken:<br />\n(a) Education departments of the government were set up to extend<br />\ncontrol over all matters regarding education.<br />\n(b) A system of universities education was introduced. Universities were established in Calcutta, Madras and Bombay.<br />\n(c) Attempts were also made to bring about changes within the system of school education.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 6. How were the views of Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi on the West different?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Both Tagore and Mahatma Gandhi thought about education in similar ways. But there were differences too. Gandhiji was highly critical of Western civilisation and its worship of machines and technology. Tagore wanted to combine elements of modem Western civilisation with what he saw as the best within Indian tradition. He emphasised the need to teach science and technology at Shantiniketan, alongwith art, music and dance.</p>\n",
                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. What was Wood&rsquo;s Despatch? What were its provisions?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Court of Directors of the East India Company in London sent an educational despatch to the Governor- General in India in the year 1854. As the despatch was issued by Charles Wood, the President of the Board of Control of the Company, it came to be known as Wood&rsquo;s Despatch. &#39; Wood&rsquo;s Despatch outlined the educational policy that was to be followed in India. It criticised the Oriental knowledge and emphasised the need of European learning. The Despatch made it clear that European learning would enable Indians to recognise the benefits that would flow from the expansion of trade and commerce. It would also make them see the importance of developing country&rsquo;s resources. Indians needed to adopt</p>\n\n<p>European ways of life because this would change their tastes and desires and create a demand for British goods.<br />\nWood&rsquo;s Despatch further argued that European learning would improve the moral character of the people of India. It would make them honest and raliable and thus supply trusted civil servants to the Company.</p>\n\n<p>The Despatch strongly criticised the literature of the East because it was full of errors and unable to instill in people a sense of duty and a commitment to work.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. What measures were undertaken by the Company to improve the system of vernacular education?</strong><br />\n<strong>Or</strong><br />\n<strong>How were the irregularities of pathshalas checked by the Company?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;There were no rules and regulations in pathshalas. Hence, the Company decided to improve the entire system. It took several measures:<br />\n(a) It appointed a numbef of government pandits, each in charge of looking after four to five schools. The task of the pandit was to vi&sect;it the pathshalas and try and improve the standard of teaching.<br />\n(b) Each guru was asked to submit periodic reports and take classes according to a regular time table.<br />\n(c) Teaching was now to be based on textbooks and learning was to be tested through a system of annual examination.<br />\n(d) Students were asked to pay a regular fee, attend regular classes, sit on fixed seats, and obey the new rules of discipline.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. What type of education did Mahatma Gandhi want in India?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Mahatma Gandhi never approved English education because it had created a feeling of inferiority in the minds of millions of Indians. In fact he wanted an education that could help the people of India restore their sense of dignity and self-respect. During the time of the national movement he urged students to leave educational institutions to show the British that they could no longer enslave Indians.</p>\n\n<p>Mahatma Gandhi never wanlfttf English to be the medium of teaching. Instead he thought that students ought to be taught in the medium of Indian languages. Education in English crippled the people of India. It distanced them from their own surroundings. It made them alien in their own lands. Hence, he felt that English education ought not to flourish in India any more.</p>\n\n<p>He urged that education ought to develop a person&rsquo;s mind and soul. Simply learning to read and write did not matter at all. People had to learn a craft and know how different things operated. This would definitely develop their mind and their capacity to understand.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. Write a note on Rabindranath Tagore and his school Shantiniketan.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Rabindranath Tagore, like Mahatma Gandhi, also did not approve Western education wholeheartedly. At the time when several Indians urged the British to open more and more schools, colleges and universities in order to spread English education in India, Rabindranath Tagore reacted strongly against such education.</p>\n\n<p>He was a great educationist But he hated going to school because he saw it oppressive. In fact he wanted to establish a school where the children were happy and were free to explore their thoughts and desires without feeling any suppression. He advocated for giving children natural surroundings where they would be able to cultivate their natural creativity.</p>\n\n<p>Keeping the above ideals in mind, Rabindranath Tagore established Shantiniketan in the year 1901. He regarded it as an &lsquo;abode of peace&rsquo;. He set up his school 100 kilometres away from Calcutta, in a rural setting in order to provide children a very peaceful environment. Here, they could develop their imagination and creativity. Tagore was of the opinion that existing schools were killing the natural desires of the children to be creative. Hence, it was necessary to help them develop their curiosity by providing them good teachers who could understand them.</p>\n\n<p>By establishing an institution like Shantiniketan he did a great job in the field of education.</p>\n",

How did the knowledge of ancient texts help the reformers promote new laws?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The reformers tried to convince people that widow burning, caste distinctions, child marriage, etc had no sanction in ancient texts. Their knowledge of ancient texts gave them immense confidence and moral support which they utilised in promoting new laws.

Why were Christian missionaries attacked by many people in the country? Would some people have supported them too? If so, for what reasons?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;People suspected that Christian missionaries were involved in forced conversion of the poor and tribal people from Hinduism to Christianity. If some people have supported them, it must be due to the reason that the poor and the tribal people, converted to Christianity, would get a golden opportunity of going to school. The school would equip them with some resources to make their way into a changing world.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 6. In the British period, what new opportunities opened up for people who came from castes that were regarded as &ldquo;low&rdquo;?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;With the expansion of cities new demands of labour created.

How did Jyotirao, the reformer, justify their criticism of caste inequality in society?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Jyotirao attacked the Brahmans, claim that they were superior to others because they were Aryans. Phule argued that the Aryans were outsiders. They came from outside the sub-continent, and defeated and subjugated the true children of the country&mdash;those who had lived here from before the coming of the Aryans. These Aryans established their dominance and began looking at the defeated population as low-caste people. Phule opined that the &ldquo;upper&rsquo; castes had no right to their land and power. The land, in fact* belonged to the natives, who were considered as low-caste people. .</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 8. Why did Phule dedicate his book Gulamgiri to the American movement to free slaves?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Jyotirao Phule wrote a book in 1873. He named the book Gulamgiri meaning slavery. Some ten years before this, the American Civil War had been fought, leading to the end of slavery in America. Phule dedicated his book to all those Americans who had fought to free slaves. He did this in order to establish a link between the conditions of the lower castes in India and the black slaves in America.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 9. What did Ambedkar want to achieve through the temple entry movement?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Ambedkar led three temple entry movements between 1927 and 1935. His sole purpose behind these movements was to make people see the power of caste prejudices within society.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 10. Why were Jyotirao Phule and Ramaswami Naicker critical of the national movement ? Did their criticism help the national struggle in any way?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;They were critical of the national movement because the nationalists often made seating arrangements following caste distinctions at feasts. The lower castes were made to sit at a distance from the upper castes. Their criticism helped the national struggle to a great extent. Ramaswamy Naicker inspired the untouchables to fight for their diginity by initiating the Self Respect Movement.</p>\n",

                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>SHORT ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. What did Raja Rammohun Roy do to end the practice of sati?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Raja Rammohun Roy was a great social reformer. He moved to see the tyranny of old practices that were deeply rooted in the Indian society. Burning of widows on the funeral pyre of their husbands was one such old practice which, Rammohun Roy felt, needed to be rooted out immediately. He began a campaign against this. As he had deep knowledge of Sanskrit, Persian and several other Indian and European languages, die tried to show through his writings that the practice of sati had no sanction in ancient texts. He got support from the British offocials who had also begun to criticise Indian traditions and customs by the early 19th century. Finally, in 1829, the practice of sati was banned.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. Give an account of the movement that spread in different parts of the country in favour of widow remarriage. Did the movement get success?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The movement in favour of widow remarriage spread in different parts of the country by the second half of the 19th century. Veerasalingam Pantulu formed an association for widow remarriage in the Telugu- speaking areas of the Madras Presidency. Around the same time young intellectuals and reformers in Bombay pledged themselves to work for the same cause. In the north the founder of the Arya Samaj Swami Dayanand Saraswati also supported widow remarriage.<br />\nHowever, the movement did not get much success. The number of widows who actually remarried remained low. Those who remarried were not easily accepted in the society. The conservative people never approved the new law.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. What do you know about Tarabai Shinde and Pandita Ramabai? What did they do for improving the condition of women.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Tarabai Shindewas a woman who got education at home at Poona. She is better known for publishing a book named Stripurushtulna meaning a comparison between women and men. She, in this book, criticises the social differences between men and women. Pandita Ramabai was a great scholar of Sanskrit. She found Hinduism very oppressive towards women and wrote a book about the pathetic condition of Hindu women belonging to upper caste. She started a widow&rsquo;s home at Poona to provide shelter to widows who had been maltreated by their husband&rsquo;s relatives. Here women were given training to make them self-dependent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. Give a brief description of movements that were organised by people from within the lower castes against caste discrimination.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;By the second half of the 19th century, people from within the lower castes began to raise voice against caste discrimination. They organised movements against this practice and demanded social equality and justice. The Satnami movement became famous in Central India. It was initiated by Ghasidas, who came from a low caste, worked among the leather workers and organised a movement to improve their social status. In Eastern Bengal, Haridas Thakur&rsquo;s Matua sect worked among low caste Chandala cultivators. Haridas questioned Brahmanical texts that supported the caste discrimination. Shri Narayana Guru belonged to Ezhavas, a low caste in present-day Kerala. He proclaimed the ideals unity of all people within one sect, a single caste and one god. By organising these movements the leaders coming from low-caste tried to create awareness amongst the lower castes.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5. Who was E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker? What, did he do to improve the condition of the untouchables?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;E.V. Ramaswamy Naicker belonged to a middle-class family. He had been an ascetic in his early life and had studied Sanskrit scriptures carefully. Afterwards, he became a member of the Congress but quit it when he found that at a feast organised by nationalists, seating arrangements followed caste discrimination, i.e. the;, lower castes were made to sit at a distance from the upper-castes. He founded Self Respect Movement which inspired untouchables to fight for their dignity. He argued that untouchables were the true upholders of an original Tamil and Dravidian culture which had been subjugated by Brahmans. He felt that all religious authorities saw social divisions and inequality as God-given. Untouchables had to free themselves from all religions to achieve equal social status.</p>\n",
                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. Why were changes necessary in Indian society?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Indian society had been a prey to many evil practices for a long time. Men and women were treated differently. Women were subjected to many restrictions. They were not allowed to go to schools. They were not allowed to choose their husbands. Child-marriage was an established custom in the society. Most children were married off at an earl^ age. Both Hindu and Muslim men could many more than one wife. In some parts of the country, sati was in practice. Those widows were praised who chose death by burning themselves on the funeral pyre of their husbands. Women&rsquo;s rights to property were also restricted.</p>\n\n<p>One more evil practice that had crippled Indian society was that all people did not enjoy equal status. The upper-caste, consisted of Brahmans and Kshatriyas, availed all privileges. But other than these people were subjected to exploitation. The untouchables, who did menial works, were considered polluting. They were not allowed to enter temples, draw water from the well used by the upper castes. They were seen as inferior human beings.</p>\n\n<p>These evil customs and practices had eclipsed the progress of society. Hence, debates and discussions began to take place from the early 19th century, with the development of new forms of communications. For the first time, books, newspapers, magazines, leaflets and pamphlets were printed. They spread awareness among the common mass.<br />\nSocial reformers like Raja Rammohun Roy, Ishwarchander Vidyasagar, came forward and took initiatives to bring changes in society by abolishing the evil practices one after Another.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. How did women involve themselves in their upliftment?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;By the end of the 19th century, Indian women themselves began to work for their upliftment. They began to get higher education in universities. Some of them trained to be doctors, some became teachers. Many women began to write and publish their critical views on the status of women in society. The name of Tarabai Shinde is worth-mentioning here. She got education at home at Poona. She published a book, Stripurushtulna, meaning a comparison between men and women. She criticised the social differences between men and women. Another woman, Pandita Ramabai, was a great scholar of Sanskrit. She&#39; criticised Hinduism which was so oppressive towards women. She wrote a book about the miserable lives of upperrcaste Hindu women. She established a widow home at Poona to provide shelter to widows who had been ill-treated in their families. From the early 20 th century, Muslim women such the Begums of Bhopal and Begum Rokeya Sakhawat Hossain played active role in spreading education among Muslim girls. They founded schools for them. Begum Rokeya Sakhawat Hossairi fearlessly criticised the conservative ideas. She argued that religious leaders of every faith accorded an inferior position to women.</p>\n\n<p>The orthodox Hindus and Muslims got alarmed to see all this. Several Hindu nationalists felt that Hindu women were adopting Western ways which would corrupt Hindu culture and erode family values. Orthodox Muslims were equally worried about the impact of these changes. Unaware of all these, women, from the early 20th century, began to form political associations, pressure groups to push through laws for female suffrage and better health care and education for them. Some of them even joined various kinds of nationalist and socialist movements from the 1920s.</p>\n",

Read the following extract (Sources 1 and 4) taken from NCERT textbook and answer the questions that follow:</strong><br />\n<strong>&ldquo;We first tie them down to the pile&rdquo;</strong><br />\n<strong>Rammohun Roy published many pamphlets to spread his ideas. Some of these were written as a dialogue between the advocate and critic of a traditional practice. Here is one such dialogue on sati:</strong><br />\n<strong>ADVOCATE OF SATI:</strong><br />\n<strong>Women are by nature of inferior understanding, without resolution, unworthy of trust ... Many of them, on the death of their husbands, become desirous of accompanying them; but to remove every chance of their trying to escape from the blazing fire, in burning them we first tie them down to the pile.</strong><br />\n<strong>OPPONENT OF SATI:</strong><br />\n<strong>When did you ever afford them a fair opportunity of exhibiting their natural capacity? How then can you accuse them of want of understanding? If, after instruction in knowledge and wisdom, a person cannot comprehend or retain what has been taught him, we may consider him as deficient; but if you do not educate women how can you see them as inferior.</strong><br />\n<strong>Questions:</strong><br />\n<strong>(a) What notions did the society have in favour of the practice of sati?</strong><br />\n<strong>(b) What arguments did the reformers put against the practice of sati?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answers:</strong><br />\n(a) The society believed women to be of inferior understanding without resolution and unworthy of trust. So, she was not allowed to live without her husband. Therefore, she was forced to be inflamed with the body of her husband after his death.<br />\n(b) The reformers accused the society for not recognising women&rsquo;s potentialities. They said that the society had never bothered to educate women and had always neglected them. So, it was quite unjustified to call them inferior and untrustworthy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. &ldquo;We are also human beings&rdquo;</strong><br />\n<strong>In 1927, Ambedkar said:</strong><br />\n<strong>We now want to go to the Tank only to prove that like others, we are also human beings ... Hindu society should be reorganised on two main principles&mdash; equality and absence of casteism.</strong><br />\n<strong>Questions:</strong><br />\n<strong>(a) Who was Ambedkar?</strong><br />\n<strong>(b) On what basis did he wish Hindu society to be reorganised?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answers:</strong><br />\n(a) Ambedkar was a dalit leader. He belonged to a Mahar family. He did a lot for the upliftment of the condition of dalits.<br />\n(b) He wished Hindu society to be reorganised on the basis of two principles&mdash; equality and absence of casteism.</p>\n\n<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>PICTURE-BASED QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1.

Tipu Sultan. But this historical episode has been re-created and re presented in a manner that serves to further the glory of the colonial masters. The artist makes use of several strategies to do so.<br />\nThe first thing to note is that we are shown a dead and defeated Tipu Surtan. He lies in some sort of a ditch with other dead men. In contrast, we see the standing and victorious David Baird. So. quite simply put. what we are presented with is the triumph and victory of the imperialist forces and the defeat of all its enemies. In the war between the Indians and the British. the British will always be &ldquo;the last ones standing&rdquo;.<br />\nDavid Baird stands on an elevated platform while Tipu lies literally at his feet. The royal clothes of &nbsp;Tipu are torn; he is without armour or weapons. This is a way of saying that the land, which had so far been protected by Tipu and others such as Tipu, is lying defenceless. at the mercy of the British. His tattered condition also signifies a lost regality. He is now no more the king of Mysore. On the other hand, there is David Baird in his formidable attire. signifying that Britain is the new ruler of Mysore. and not only of Mysore but also of the entire land known as India. This is sort of reinforced by David Baird&rsquo;s forefinger. which points in an undefined, general direction. Through the pointing of his forefinger. David Baird seems to say, &ldquo;There is still a lot to conquer and subdue&rdquo;. Already by pointing away from the moment at hand. Baird shows that Tipu Sultan &iexcl;s part of the past. The future beckons the British. Tipu Sultan lying in semi-darkness and David Baird being lit up by the lantern are also strategies that seem to suggest the invincibility and all-powerful nature of the coloniser. Tipu is the setting sun while the East India Company (through the figure of David Baird) is the rising sun. In fact, at one time, the colonisers believed that the sun never set on the British Empire. The play with light and shade tends to highlight only one aspect of the battle. i.e., the victory of the imperial forces The tragedy that accompanied this victory is relegated to the darkness So, the artist&rsquo;s attempt is to present a triumph and glory in its unmitigated form.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. Why did the scroll painters and potters come to Kalighat? Why did they begin to paint new themes?<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nAround the early nineteenth century, local village scroll painters and potters moved to Kalighat. It was a time when the city of Calcutta was expanding as a commercial and administrative centre. Colonial offices were coming up. new buildings and roads were being built, markets were being established. The city appeared as the place of opportunity where people could come to make a new living. These village artists too came and settled in the city in the hope of new patrons and new buyers of their art. After the 1840s. there was a shift in what the Kalighat artists produced&mdash;from paintings related to mythology and religion, they began to produce paintings on social and political themes. In these paintings, they depicted the social lite under British rule. This change was the result of living in a society where values, tastes, social norms and customs were undergoing rapid changes. Their paintings were their ways of responding to the world around them. For example. Kalighat paintings of this period often ridiculed the westernised baboo. criticised the corrupt priests and expressed the anger of the common people against the rich.</p>\n",
                "<p><strong>Question 5. Why can we think of Raja Ravi Varma&#39;s paintings as national?<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nRaja Ravi Varma was one of the first artists who tried to create a style that was both modern and national He used the Western art of oil painting and realistic life study to paint themes from Indian mythology. He dramatised on canvas scene after scene from the Indian epics Rama yana and Mahabharata. This portrayal of an Indian consciousness is what makes his paintings national This was perhaps one of the reasons why his paintings were popular not only among Indian princes and art collectors but also among the masses.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 6. In what way did the British history paintings in India reflect the attitudes of imperial conquerors?<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nThe British history paintings sought to dramatise and recreate various episodes of British imperial history These paintings celebrated the British: their power, their victories and their supremacy. The imperial history paintings attempted to create a public memory of imperial triumphs Victories had to be remembered. implanted in the memory of people, both in India and Britain. Only then could the British appear invincible and all-powerful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 7. Why do you think some artists wanted to develop a national style of art?<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nMany painters, towards the end of nineteenth century, wanted to establish a stronger connection between art and nationalism. To do so, they tried to develop a style of art that could be considered both modern and Indian. This attempt to create a national style of art can be seen in the works produced by Raja Ravi Varma. He used the Western art of oil painting and realistic life study to portray scene after scene from the Indian mythology. However, there never was a clear consensus as to what defined an authentic Indian style of art. Nationalist artists like Abanindranath Tagore rejected the art of Ravi Varma and felt that a genuine Indian style of painting needed to draw inspiration from non-Western art traditions, and try to capture the spiritual essence of the East. So. they turned to medieval Indian traditions of miniature painting and the ancient Indian art of mural painting. They were also influenced by the Japanese art tradition.<br />\nThere were others who felt that an authentic Indian style of art would be one which explored the real life instead of illustrating ancient books: one which looked for inspiration from living folk art and tribal designs rather than ancient art forms. Ultimately, what all these artists aimed at representing was a certain national consciousness with which each Indian could relate.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 8. Why did some artists produce cheap popular prints? What influence would such prints have had on the minds of people who looked at them?<br />\nAnswer:</strong><br />\nBy the late nineteenth century mechanical printing presses were set up in different parts of lndia This allowed prints to be produced in large numbers These prints could therefore be sold cheap in the market. As a result, even the poor could buy them With the spread of nationalism, the popular prints of the early twentieth century began carrying nationalist messages Such popular prints would have inspired people to fight British rule.</p>\n"

Why were people dissatisfied with British rule in the 1870s and 1880s?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;People were dissatisfied with British rule in the 1870s and 1880s due to the following reasons:<br />\n(i) The British passed the Arms Act in 1878 which disallowed Indians from possessing arms.<br />\n(ii) In the same year they passed the Vernacular Press Act. This Act snatched the freedom of speech and expression. It allowed the government to confiscate the assets of newspapers including their printing presses if the newspapers published anything that was critical of the government.<br />\n(iii) In 1883, the Ilbert Bill was introduced. The bill provided for the trial of British or European persons by Indians and sought equality between British and Indian judges in the country. But the white opposition forced the government to withdraw the bill.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. Who did the Indian National Congress wish to speak for?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Indian National Congress wished to speak for the entire people belonging to different communities of India.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. What economic impact did the First World War have on India?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The First World War led to a huge rise in the defence expenditure of the Government of India. The government in turn increased taxes on individual incomes and business profits. Increased military expenditure and the demands for war supplies led to the sharp rise in prices which badly affected the common mass. They found it difficult to fulfil even their essential needs.<br />\nBut the business groups earned huge profits from the war. The war created a demand for industrial goods like jute bags, cloth, rails, and caused a decline of imports from other countries into India. As a result Indian industries expanded during the war.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. What did the Muslim League resolution of 1940 ask for?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Muslim League resolution of 1940 asked for &ldquo;Independent States&rsquo; for Muslims in the north-western and eastern areas of the country. The resolution did not mention partition or the name Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5. Who were the Moderates? How did they propose to struggle against British rule?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Moderates were against taking extreme actions. They had deep faith in the good intention of the government. They^were of the opinion that slowly and steadily they would make the British go to their own land. The Moderate leaders developed public awareness about the unjust nature of British rule. They published newspapers, wrote articles and showed how British rule was leading to the economic ruin of the country. They criticised British rule in their speeches and sent representatives to different parts of the country to mobilise public opinion. They believed that the British had respect for the ideals of freedom and justice and therefore they would definitely accept all the just demands of the people of India. Their main task was to acknowledge the British government with these demands.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 6. How was the politics of the Radicals within the Congress different from that of the Moderates?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Radicals within the Congress cherished different opinions. They had deep faith in action and wanted to drive away the foreigners as soon as possible. They criticised the Moderates for their &ldquo;politics of prayers&rsquo; and gave emphasis on self-reliance and constructive work. They argued that people must fight for swaraj. Unless they fought against the British rule unitedly, they would not bring independence to their country.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 7. Discuss the various forms of the Non-Cooperation Movement took in different parts of India. How did the people understand Gandhiji?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Non-Cooperation Movement spread far and wide. It took various forms in different parts of the country:<br />\n(i) In Kheda, Gujarat, Patidar peasants were worried about the high land revenue demand of the British. Hence, they orgainsed non-violent campaigns againgt it.<br />\n(ii) In coastal Andhra and interior Tamil Nadu, liquor shops were picketed.<br />\n(iii) In the Guntur district of Andhra Pradesh, tribals and poor peasants started several forest satyagrahas&rsquo;, sometimes sending their cattle into forests without paying grazing tax. They were very much fed up with the restrictions imposed on them by the British regarding the use of forest resources. They wanted the abolition of the forest regulations.<br />\n(iv) In Sind, now in Pakistan, Muslim traders and peasants were very enthusiastic about the Khilafat call. In Bengal too, the Khilafat-Non- Cooperation alliance gave enormous communal unity and strength to the national movement.<br />\n(v) In Punjab, the Akali agitation of the Sikhs sought to drive out corrupt mahants, supported by the British, from the gurudwaras. This movement got closely identified with the Non-Cooperation Movement.<br />\n(vi) In Assam, tea garden labourers left the British-owned plantations and became the followers of Gandhiji. People viewed Gandhiji as a messiah, as someone who could help them overcome their misery and poverty.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n",
                "<p><strong>Question 8. Why did Gandhiji choose to break the salt law?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Gandhiji was very much worried about the salt law. According to this law, the state had a monopoly on the manufacture and sale of salt. Gandhiji thought that it was sinful to tax salt because it is an essential item of our food and is required equally by the rich and the poor. Hence he decided to break this law in anticipation that people from all walks of life would extend their support. Needless to say that Gandhiji&rsquo;s Salt March became very successful.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 9. Discuss those developments of the 1937-47period that led to the creation of Pakistan.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;From the late-1930s, the Muslim League began viewing the Muslims as a separate-nation from the Hindus. This nation might have developed because of the history of tension between some Hindu and Muslim groups in the 1920s and 1930s. The provincial elections of 1937 also might have convinced the League the Muslims were a minority and they would always have to play second fiddle, in any democratic structure. Meanwhile, the Congress rejected the League&rsquo;s desire to form a joint Congress-League government jn the United Provinces in 1937. This annoyed the League.<br />\nIn 1940, the League finally moved a resolution demanding &lsquo;Independent States&rsquo; for Muslims in the north&not;western and eastern areas of the country. The resolution did not mention partition or Pakistan.<br />\nIn 1945, the British opened negotiations between the Congress, the League and themselves for the independence of India. The talks could not succeed because the League saw itself as the sole spokesperson of India&rsquo;s Muslims. The Congress proved this claim baseless because several Muslims still supported it.<br />\nIn the provincial electrons in 1946 the League got grand success in the seats reserved for Muslims. Hence it persisted its demand for Pakistan.<br />\nIn March 1946, the Cabinet Mission came to Delhi to examine this demand and to suggest a suitable political framework for a free India. This Mission suggested that India should remain united and constitute itself as a loose confederation with some autonomy for Muslim-majority areas. Neither the Congress nor the Muslim League agreed to it. The failure of the Cabinet Mission made partition inevitable. Ultimately in 1947 partition took place with the birth of a new country, i.e. Pakistan.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 10.

                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. What was the Rowlatt Act? Give an account of the Rowlatt Satyagraha.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The British passed the Rowlatt Act in the year 1919. The Act curbed fundamental rights such as the freedom of expression and strengthened police powers. The Act was very repressive and therefore it enraged Indians. Prominent leaders of the freedom struggles such as Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad Ali Jinnah, etc. felt that the government had no right to restrict the basic freedoms of people. They viewed the Act as devilish and tyrannical. Gandhiji decided to oppose this Act. He asked people of India to observe 6 April 1919 as a day of non-violent opposition to the Act, as a day of &ldquo;humiliation and prayer&rsquo; and hartal. He organised Satyagraha Sabhas to launch the movement.</p>\n\n<p>The Rowlatt Satyagraha spread far and wide. It became the first All- India struggle against the British government. In April 1919 several demonstrations and hartals took place in the country. But the government suppressed them taking brutal measures. The Jallianwala Bagh massacre was the climax of its brutality. This incident took place on 13 April in Amritsar on Baishakhi day. Thousands of people had gathered in the Jallianwala Bagh to celebrate the occasion. General Dyre opened fire on them all of a sudden.<br />\nBoth Hindu and Muslim unitedly criticised the British action.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question.2. Describe Gandhi&rsquo;s march to Dandi.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer.</strong>&nbsp;Gandhiji felt that Purna Swaraj would not come on its own. It had to be fought for. He was very much worried about government&rsquo;s Salt Law. In 1930, he decided to break this law.</p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https://learncbse-test.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/e2771fcc-d1e9-4d25-ba81-5606e6867acc_The-Making-of-the-National-Movement-2.jpg\" style=\"width:100%\" />According to the law, the state had a monopoly on the manufacture and sale of salt. Mahatma Gandhi and other prominent leaders of the freedom struggle thought that it was sinful to tax salt because it is an essential item of our food. Both the rich and the poor needed it equally. Gandhiji felt that his Salt March would become popular and would represent the genral desire of freedom to a specific grievance shared by all. On 6 April, 1930, Gandhiji alongwith his followers marched for over 240 miles from Sabarmati to the coastal town of Dandi. Here, they broke the government law by gathering natural salt found on the seashore, and boiling sea water to produce salt.&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>A large number of people including women participated in this historic march. The government tried to crush the movement through brutal action against peaceful satyagrahis. Thousands were arrested and sent to jail. But the movement played a significant role in achieving freedom of India.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. Under what circumstances did Gandhiji initiate the Quit India Movement?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;In September 1939, the Second World War broke out. The. British government in India needed help from the Indian leaders. The leaders were ready to support the British war effort. But in return they wanted that India be granted independence after the war. The British refused to accept the demand. This enraged the Congress ministries. They all resigned to show their protest.<br />\nMahatma Gandhi was deeply perturbed. He now decided to initiate a new phase of movement against the British rule in the middle of the Second World War. This movement came to be known as the Quit India Movement. Gandhiji thought that the British must Quit India without further delay. He raised the slogan &lsquo;do or die&rsquo; which spread among the common mass very soon. But at the same time he warned the people not to be violent in any condition.</p>\n\n<p>The British took repressive measures. Gandhiji along with other leaders were sent to jail immediately. But this did not prevent the movement from spreading. It specially attracted peasants and the youth who gave up their studies to join the movement. Communications and symbols of state authority were attacked all over the country. In several areas people set up their own governments. The British tried to repress these developments severely. About 90,000 people were arrested and wound 1,000 killed in police firing. But the movement did not go in vain. It brought freedom very close.</p>\n",

                "<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Extra Questions</strong></h3>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1.&nbsp;</strong>Name some of the political associations that were formed in the 1870s and 1880s. What were their goals?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nPolitical associations formed in the 1870s and 1880s mostly by Indian lawyers educated in Britain. Some of these Associations were, the Indian National Congress, the Poona Sarvajanik Sabha, the Indian Association, the Madras Mahajan Sabha and the Bombay Presidency Association.<br />\nThese associations functioned in different parts of the country, with a common goal for all the people of India. The common goal was an independent India, empowered to take decisions regarding its own governance.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2.&nbsp;</strong>What was the Ilbert Bill?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nThe Ilbert Bill was a bill introduced in 1883 for British India by Lord Ripon. The Bill gave Indian judges and magistrates the power to try British offenders in criminal cases at the District level. The introduction of the bill led to intense opposition in Britain and from British settlers in India. The Bill played on racial tensions. White opposition forced the government to withdraw the bill. This enraged the Indians. The bitter controversy deepened antagonism between the British and Indians and was a prelude to the formation of the Indian National Congress the following year. The event highlighted the racial attitudes of the British in India. The need for an all-India organisation of educated Indians seemed necessary after the Ilbert Bill controversy.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3.&nbsp;</strong>What brought the moderates and radicals together?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nIn 1905 Viceroy Curzon partitioned Bengal which was the biggest province of British India and included Bihar and parts of Orissa. The government separated East Bengal and merged it with Assam.<br />\nThe British stated that Bengal was divided for administrative convenience; where as the real reason was to restrict the influence of Bengali politicians and to split the Bengali people.<br />\nIt was this division of Bengal that brought the moderates and radicals together. All the leaders opposed the division. Large public meetings and demonstrations were organised and novel methods of mass protest developed.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4.&nbsp;</strong>Describe the Rowlatt Satyagraha.<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nIn 1919 Gandhiji gave a call for a Satyagraha<em>&nbsp;</em>against the Rowlatt Act, passed by the British. The Act restricted the freedom of expression and strengthened police powers. Mahatma Gandhi, Mohammad Ali Jinnah and others strongly opposed this Act.<br />\nApril 6<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;1919, was observed as a day opposing the Act. It was a non-violent opposition.<br />\nSatyagraha Sabhas were set up all over India against the Rowlatt Act. It was the first all-India struggle against the British government.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5.&nbsp;</strong>What did the Khilafat movement support?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nThe Khilafat movement was a political campaign launched mainly by Muslims in South Asia to influence the British government and to protect the Ottoman Empire after World War I.<br />\nIn 1920 the movement gained force after the Treaty of S&egrave;vres, which solidified the partitioning of the Ottoman Empire. Indian Muslims were keen that the Khalifa be allowed to retain control over Muslim sacred places in the erstwhile Ottoman Empire. The leaders of the Khilafat agitation, Mohammad Ali and Shaukat Ali, now wished to initiate a full-fledged Non-Cooperation Movement. Gandhiji supported the movement.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 6.&nbsp;</strong>What made Gandhiji call off the non-cooperation movement?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nAs the Non-Cooperation Movement turned violent in some places Gandhiji called off the movement. The main incidence that made Gandhiji call off the movement was Chauri Chaura incidence. Here the peasants set fire to a police station and 22 policemen died. The setting of the police station was in retaliation to the police firing at a peaceful demonstration by the peasants.</p>\n"

What did Dr. Ambedkar mean when he said that In politics we will have equality, and in social and economic life we will have inequality&rdquo;?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;What Ambedkar wanted to say was that providing voting right to the lower caste people would not remove other inequalities such as between rich and poor, or between upper castes and lower castes. These classes of people could be labelled equal only politically but in reality it could not be possible due to our social and economic structure.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 6. After Independence, why was there a reluctance to divide the country on Uguistic times?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;India got independence at the cost of its division. This division had been done on the basis of religion. As a result of this division more than a million people had been killed in riots between Hindus and Muslims. In such circumstances, it was not wise to further divide the country on the basis of language. Therefore, both Prime Minister Nehru and Deputy Prime Minister Patel were against the creation of linguistic states.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 7. Give one reason why English continued to be used in India after Independence.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;English continued to be used in India after Independence because south Indian states expressed strong opposition to Hindi.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 8. How was the economic development of India visualised in the early decades after Independence?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;In 1950, the government set up a Planning Commission to help design and execute suitable policies for economic development. There was a broad agreement on &ldquo;mixed economy&rsquo; model. Here, both the state and the private sector would play important and complementary roles in increasing production and generating jobs. Now, it was on the Planning Commission to define which industries should be initiated by the state and which by the market and how to achieve a balance between the different regions and states.<br />\nIn 1956, the Second Five Year Plan was formulated which focused on the development of heavy industries such as steel, and on the building of large dams. These sectors would be under the control of the state. This focus on heavy industry, and the effort at state regulation of the economy was to guide economic policy for the next few decades.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 9. Who was Mira Behn?

She left England to live and work with Mahatma Gandhi. She devoted her life to human development, the advancement of Gandhiji&rsquo;s principles and to the freedom struggle. She was awarded the Padma Vibhushan in 1982&rsquo;</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 10. Find out more about the language divisions in Pakistan that led to the creation of the new nation of Bangladesh. How did Bangladesh achieve independence from Pakistan?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Pakistan was divided into two regions&mdash;East Pakistan and West Pakistan. This division was done on the basis of linguistic majority. The East Pakistan was dominated by Bengala-speaking Muslims while the West Pakistan was dominated by Urdu-speaking Muslims. The people of the West Pakistan always considered the Bengali Muslims living in the East Pakistan inferior to them. So, the Muslims living in East Pakistan were devoid of all facilities and fundamental rights. It caused great dissatisfaction among them. They began migrating to India. Their number grew so large that India was compelled to intervene the situation. It supported the cause of the East Pakistan which resulted in a war between India and Pakistan. Finally India won the war in favour of the East Pakistan and declared it as a new country named Bangladesh on 16th December 1971. Bangladesh was now recognised as a sovereign nation and Muziburr Rehman was its first President.</p>\n",

                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>SHORT ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. What created problems in unifying the people of India after it got independence?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The points that created problems were:<br />\n(a) At the time of independence, India&#39;s population was large. It was divided too. There were divisions between high castes and low castes, between the majority Hindu community and Indians who practised other faiths.<br />\n(b) The citizen of this country spoke different languages, wore different kinds of dresses, ate different kinds of foods and practised different professions.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. What was the label of development of India at the time it got independence?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;At the time India got independence the label of its development was very low. A vast majority of Indians lived in the villages. Farmers and peasants depended on the monsoon for their survival. So did the non-farm sector of the rural economy, for if the crops failed, barbers, carpenters, weavers and other service groups would not get paid for their services either.<br />\nIn the cities too the condition was not good. Factory workers usually lived in crowded slums. They had little access to education and health care.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. What special privileges were offered for the poorest and most disadvantaged Indians by the constitution?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;First of all the practice of untouchability was abolished. Hindu temples were thrown open to all including the former untouchables.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li>A certain percentage of seats in legislatures as well as jobs in government were reserved for members of the lowest castes.</li>\n\t<li>Along with the former untouchables, the adivasis also known as the Scheduled Tribes were also granted reservation in seats and jobs. They too had been deprived and discriminated against like the Scheduled Castes.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. How have powers and functions of the Central and State Governments been divided by the Constitution?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Indian Constitution gives the division of power in the form of three lists, known as Union List, State List and Concurrent List. The Union List includes subjects such as taxes, defence and foreign affairs. On these subjects the central government makes the laws. The State List includes subjects such as education and health. It is the exclusive responsibility of the state government to take care of these subjects. In the last comes the Concurrent List which contains subjects such as forests and agriculture. On these subjects the Centre and the States have joint responsibility.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5. Under what circumstances a compromise was made with respect to language?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Several members of the Constituent Assembly believed that the English language should be driven out of India with the British rule. They were of the opinion that Hindi should take place of English language. However, those who did not speak Hindi were of different opinion. T.T. Krishnamachari on behalf of the people of the south strongly opposed Hindi. Some threatened to separate from India if Hindi was imposed on them. Finally, a compromise was made. It was decided that while Hindi would be the &lsquo;official language&rsquo; of India, English would be used in the courts, the services, and communications between one state and another.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 6. Under what circumstances did the new state of Andhra Pradesh come into being?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The decision of the Congress leaders not to divide the country on linguistic lines disappointed the Kannada speakers, Malayalam speakers and the Marathi speakers. They had all looked forward to having their own state. The Telugu-speaking districts of what was the Madras Presidency raised the strongest protests. In October 1952, a veteran Gandhian named Potti Sriramulu went on a hunger fast demanding the formation of Andhra state to protect the interests of Telugu-speakers. The fast went on and with it hartals and bandhs began to be observed. Meanwhile, Potti Sriramulu died. This incidence intensified the situation. The protests now became widespread and intense. This forced the Central Government to give in to demand. On 1 October, 1953, the new state of Andhra Pradesh came into being.</p>\n",
                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. Give a detailed descriptions of the features of the Indian Constitution.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;We have a written Constitution which was adopted on 26 January 1950.<br />\n<strong>Features:</strong><br />\n(a) One feature of the Indian Constitution was that it adopted universal adult franchise. All Indians above the age of 21 (now 18) would be allowed to vote in state and national elections.<br />\n(b) Our Constitution guaranteed equality before the law to all citizens, regardless of their caste or religious affiliation.<br />\n(c) The Constitution offered special privileges for the poorest and most disadvantaged Indians. The evil practice of untouchability was abolished. Hindu temples were thrown open to all, including the former untouchables. After a long debate, the Constituent Assembly also recommended that a certain percentage of seats in legislatures as well as jobs in government be reserved for members of the lowest castes, including the adivasis.<br />\n(d) Our Constitution clearly defined the powers and functions of the central and the state governments. It gave division of power in the form of three lists&mdash;a Union List with subjects such as taxes, defence and foreign affairs, which would be the exclusive responsibility of the Centre, a State List of subjects such as education and health, which would be taken care of mainly by the States, a Concurrent List under which would come subjects such as forests and agriculture in which the Centre and the States would have joint responsibility.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. Write in brief the process of state formation.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The Congress leaders were in no mood to further divide the country on linguistic lines. This created great<br />\ndisappointment among the Kannada speakers, Malayalam speakers, and the Marathi speakers, and the Telugu speakers, because they had all looked forward to having their own state. The Telugu speakers, however, showed the strongest protests. Their leader Potti Sriramulu went on a hunger fast demanding the formation of Andhra state to protect the interests of Telugu speakers. As the fast went on, it attracted much Hartals and bandhs began to be observed. Meanwhile, Potti Sriramulu died. This incidence intensified the situation. The protests took intense form. This forced the Central Government to give in to the demand and the new state of Andhra Pradesh came into existence on 1 October, 1953.<br />\nAfter the formation of Andhra Pradesh, other linguistic communities also demanded their own separate states. Hence, a State Reorganisation Commission was set up, which submitted its report in 1956. It recommended the redrawing of district and provincial boundaries to form compact provinces of Assamese, Bengali, Oriya, Tamil, Malayalam, Kannada and Telugu speakers respectively. The large Hindi-speaking region of north India was broken up into several states. Then in 1960, the bilingual state of Bombay was divided into separate states for Marathi and Gujarati speakers. In the year 1960, the state of Punjab was also divided into Punjab and Haiyana, Punjab for the Punjabi speakers and Haryana for the rest who spoke Haryanvi or Hindi.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. Give an account of the successes and failures of the country during sixty-two years of its independence.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Sixty-two years of independence have passed. This duration covers a long journey. A lot have been achieved during this time. But at the same time there have been a number of failures.<br />\n<strong>Successes:</strong><br />\n(a) India is still united and it is still democratic. These achievements definitely make us proud. Many foreign observers had felt that India could not survive as a single country. Others believed that it would come under military rule. Neither of these predictions proved to be true. As many as thirteen general elections have been held since independence, as well as hundreds of state and local elections.<br />\n(b) There is a free press and an idependent judicially.<br />\n(c) The fact that people speak different languages or practise different faiths has not come in the way of national unity.<br />\n<strong>Failures:</strong><br />\n(a) Deep divisions are still there. Despite constitutional guarantees, people belonging to the lowest castes, such as dalits face violence and discrimination. In many parts of rural India they are not allowed access to water sources, temples, parks and other public places.<br />\n(b) The gulf between the rich and the poor has grown over the years. Some groups of people avail all facilities while many others continue to live below the poverty line.<br />\n(c) Our Constitution provides equality before the law but in real life this does not happen. Some Indians are more equal than others.</p>\n",

                "<h3 style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>Extra Questions</strong></h3>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1</strong><br />\nWhat were the problems that faced the new government after independence?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nA majority of Indians lived in villages and development of villages was the need of the hour. Agriculture had to be improved as farmers and peasants depended on the monsoon for their survival.<br />\nBarbers, carpenters, weavers and other service groups of the non-farm sector of the rural economy would not get paid for their services if the crops failed, so the government was faced with the task of building dams for irrigation.<br />\nIn the cities, factory workers lived in crowded slums and had little access to education or health care, the government had to draft schemes to educate the poor and provide adequate health care.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2</strong><br />\nWhat were the new Government&rsquo;s priorities?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nA vast majority of people had to be lifted above the poverty line and to achieve this agricultural productivity had to be increased to feed the enormous population. Industries had to be set up to provide jobs for the jobless. These were the government&rsquo;s main priorities after independence.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3</strong><br />\nWrite a brief note on the Constituent Assembly.<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nThe Constituent Assembly was set up to draft out the constitution of India. The Constituent Assembly met numerous times while the Indian constitution was being written. The writing of the constitution took almost three years to be completed; from December 1946 to November 1949.<br />\nThe meetings of the &quot;Constituent Assembly&quot; were held in New Delhi. The members of the assembly came from all over India, and from different political parties. The most important role was played by Dr B.R. Ambedkar, who was Chairman of the Drafting Committee. Under the supervision of Dr B.R. Ambedkar the document was finalised.<br />\nThe Indian constitution was completed and adopted on 26 January 1950. On 26<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;January, India became a Republic and since Republic Day has been celebrated on 26<sup>th</sup>&nbsp;January every year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4</strong><br />\nWhat is Universal adult franchise? Was it adopted by the Indian constitution?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nUniversal adult franchise is the right or privilege of voting. The Indian Constitution adopted universal adult franchise. All Indians above the age of 21 would be allowed to vote in state and national elections.<br />\nThis was a revolutionary step as Indians have never been allowed to choose their own leaders.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5</strong><br />\nHow was the &lsquo;right to vote&rsquo; in adopted in the UK and the US?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nIn countries like United Kingdom and the United States, the right to vote was granted in stages. First only men of property had the vote, next men who were educated had the right to vote. After a long struggle working-class men got the vote. And finally, after a bitter struggle American and British women were granted the vote.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 6</strong><br />\nWrite a brief not on abolition of untouchability and Reservation Policy.<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nAbolition of untouchability and the Reservation Policy was another important feature of the Indian constitution. The Constitution offered special privileges for the poorest and most disadvantaged Indians.<br />\nThe practice of untouchability was abolished. Hindu temples, previously open to only the higher castes, were thrown open to all, including the untouchables.<br />\nThe Constituent Assembly recommended that a certain percentage of seats in legislatures as well as jobs in government be reserved for members of the lowest castes.<br />\nMany members of the Constituent Assembly argued against the Reservation policy. But many members stated that the policy was necessary to uplift the Harijans as they have been suppressed for thousands of years.<br />\nAlong with the former Untouchables, the Adivasis<em>&nbsp;</em>or Scheduled Tribes were also granted reservation in Educational Institutions and jobs. Like the Scheduled Castes, these Indians too had been deprived and discriminated against. The new constitution sought to provide them with good education, health care and a profitable livelihood.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 7</strong><br />\nWhat are 3 lists of subjects that the constitution has provided to balance the different views on power sharing between the centre and the state?<br />\n<strong>Solution:</strong><br />\nThe 3 lists of subjects provided by the constitution are&hellip;</p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li>A Union List, with subjects such as taxes, defence and foreign affairs, which would be the exclusive responsibility of the Centre</li>\n\t<li>A State List of subjects, such as education and health, which would be taken care of principally by the states</li>\n\t<li>A Concurrent List, under which would come subjects such as forests and agriculture, in which the Centre and the states would have joint responsibility.</li>\n</ul>\n"

Answer the following questions.</strong><br />\n(i) Why are resources distributed unequally over the earth?<br />\n(ii) What is resource development?<br />\n(iii) Why are human resources important?<br />\n(iv) What is sustainable development?<br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong><br />\n(i) The distribution of resources depends on various factors such as physical nature of the place. The physical factors include terrain, climate, height above sea level, etc. Since these factors vary in different parts of the world, resources are pot distributed over the earth.<br />\n(ii) Resource development is the method of utilising our intelligence in order to improve the quality, usability and utility of a resource.<br />\n(iii) Human resources are important because they have an intelligent mind which can make best use of nature to create more resources. Had humans not been there, different substances would not have been resources. Their utility can only be realised by human beings.<br />\n(iv) We should use resources in such a balanced way that we satisfy our needs as well as conserve them for future. This concept is called sustainable development.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2.

Activity</strong><br />\n<strong>&ldquo;Rahiman paani raakhiye,</strong><br />\n<strong>Bin paani sab soon.</strong><br />\n<strong>Paani gaye na ubere Mod, manus, choon...&rdquo;</strong><br />\n<strong>[Says Rahim, keep water, as without water there is nothing. Without water pearl, swan and dough cannot exist.] These lines were written by the poet Abdur Rahim Khankhanam, one of the nine gems of Akbar&rsquo;s court. What kind of resource is the poet referring to? Write in 100 words what would happen if this resource disappeared?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The resource referred to by the poet is the water. It is one of the most indispensable resources of life. It can be said to be one of the preconditions of life, like air. Firstly, water serves the most basic purpose of drinking, without which life is not possible. In the absence of water, one would be unable to clean clothes, utensils, or even take a bath. Farmers depend on water for irrigation. Rainwater is so important for proper agriculture. Water is also used in cooking food. Nowadays water has proved to be a useful source of electricity. Besides human beings, plants require water for their growth. Water is also required for various industrial purposes in factories. In short, no form of life can go on without water.</p>\n",

                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>VERY SHORT ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. What is the condition for a substance to be called a resource?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;A substance needs to have some utility to be called a resource.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. What do you understand by the word &ldquo;utility&rdquo;?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;If a substance can be used in any way, it is said to have a utility.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. What are natural resources?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Resources that are drawn directly from nature are called natural resources.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. What is the name given to the type of resources that have limited stock?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The resources having limited stock are called non-renewable resources.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5. How are resources classified according to their distribution?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;On the basis of their distribution, resources are classified into ubiquitous and localised.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 6. Give three examples of abiotic resources.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Air, land, soils.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 7. How are human-made resources different from natural resources?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Human-made resources Jiave been created by human beings, whereas natural resources are provided by nature.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 8. What is human resource development?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Improving the quality of human skills in order to make them more useful is called human resource development.</p>\n",
                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>SHORT ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. Explain the terms resource conservation and sustainable development.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Resource conservation is the concept of using resources carefully so that they do not end up quickly. The future generations also need the resources, but if we keep using them at a fast pace, they may end up, thus posing problems for the future. We should use resources in such a balanced way that we satisfy our needs as well as conserve them for future. This concept is called sustainable development.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. Why are human beings resources?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Human beings are intelligent living beings. They can use their intelligence to realise the utility of substances. Had there been no humans, the resources would not have been resources. Human beings are interdependent on each other, and they prove useful to each other. For example, a postman renders us an important service, so he is a resource.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. Explain how resources are classified broadly.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Resources are broadly classified into natural, human-made and human. Natural resources are those that are taken from nature. They are used without modifying them, i.e. in the same form as they exist in. Rivers, lakes, air, soils, minerals, trees, mountains, etc. are natural resources. Human-made resources have not been provided to us by nature. Human beings have used their intelligence to manufacture them for their own use. Examples include vehicles, buildings, roads, telephone, etc.<br />\nHuman resources include people who serve us in any way. A teacher, doctor, carpenter, cobbler, etc. are human resources.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. Write a short note on the significance of time and technology in making a substance a resource.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Time and technology are important factors in making substances resources. With time, technology develops. As technology develops, we begin to discover new ways to make life better. In this process, certain substances which were useless to us earlier become useful. An invention and discovery gives us new resources. An example is hydroelectricity. This technology has made water a source of electricity.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5. As human beings, how can we ensure sustainable development?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Since we live on the earth, it is our duty to practice sustainable development. We can do this by ensuring that:<br />\n(a) The usage of renewable resources is sustainable,<br />\n(b) The diversity of life on earth is maintained,<br />\n(c) The damage caused to nature by our activities is&#39;as Tow as possible.</p>\n",
                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. Describe how resources are classified.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Resources are broadly classified into natural, human-made and human. Natural resources are those that are taken from nature. They are used without modifying them, i.e. in the same form as they exist in. Rivers, lakes, air, soils, minerals, trees, mountains, etc. are natural resources. Human-made resources have not been provided to us by nature. Human beings have used their intelligence to manufacture them for their own use. Examples include vehicles, buildings, roads, telephone, etc.</p>\n\n<p>Human resources include people who serve us in any way. A teacher, doctor, carpenter, cobbler, etc are human resources.<br />\nOn the basis of level,of development, a resource can be actual or potential. An actual resource is one which is used currently. We know their quantity. A potential resource is one whose utility is not known at present or is not used despite having utility; instead it may be useful at some time in future. It means that it has the potential to have utility, although it does not have any today.</p>\n\n<p>On the basis of origin, a resource can be abiotic or biotic. A biotic resource is one that has life. An abiotic resource is non-living. Natural resources may also be classified as renewable and non&not;renewable. A renewable resource can be used without any risk of its ending up. They exist in unlimited quantity. On the other hand, use of non-renewable resources need to be controlled since once they end up, they cannot be renewed.</p>\n\n<p>On the basis of distribution, a resource can be ubiquitous or localised. A ubiquitous resource is found everywhere. A localised resource is however found in certain parts of the world only.</p>\n"

                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>SHORT ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. How is land being degraded? Suggest methods to conserve land resource.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The ever-growing population has increased demand for living space, due to which forests are being destroyed, thus causing land degradation. The rate of degradation of land resources can be checked by promoting afforestation, land reclamation, regulated use of chemical pesticide and fertilisers and checking overgrazing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. What is weathering?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Weathering refers to the breaking up and decay of exposed rocks. This breaking up and decay is caused by temperature fluctuations between too high and too low, frost action, plants, animals and even human activity. Weathering is the major process involved in the formation of soil. It takes millions of years to form soil by this process.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. How is water an important resource?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Water is an indispensable resource of life. Firstly water serves the most basic purpose of drinking, without which life is impossible. It is helpful in cleaning our bodies, clothes and utensils. Farmers depend on water for irrigation. Water is also used in cooking food. Water is a source of electricity as well. Plants require water for their growth. Water is required for various industrial purposes in factories.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. Write a short note on wildlife.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The animal kingdom, which consists of animals, birds, aquatic creatures and insects, is called wildlife. These creatures provide us various important products such as milk, meat, hides and wool. Bees give us honey and help in pollination. They play the role of decomposers in the environment. Birds like the vulture are scavengers and they help in cleansing the environment. All forms of wildlife are an integral part of our ecosystem.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5. What are the major types of vegetation in the world? Describe vegetation in different rainfall conditions.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The major types of vegetation in the world are grouped as forests, grasslands, scrubs and tundra.&rdquo; In areas of heavy rain, huge trees can be found. Forests are abundant in areas of heavy rainfall. With moisture and rainfall the density of forests declines. In moderate rainfall areas, grasslands are found. In diy areas we find thorny shrubs and scrubs. Plants here have deep roots and leaves have thorny surface to reduce loss of moisture. The tundra vegetation consists of mosses and lichens.</p>\n",
                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. Describe methods of soil conservation.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Some common methods of soil conservation are mentioned below: Mulching. Mulching is the process of covering the bare ground between plants with a layer of organic matter like straw. It contributes in retaining soil moisture.<br />\nTerrace Farming. Terrace farming is the method of farming in which broad flat steps or terraces are made on the steep slopes so that flat surfaces are available to grow crops 4 They reduce run-off and soil erosion. Intercropping. In intercropping, different crops are grown in alternate rows and are sown at different times to protect the soil from being washed away by rain.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Contour Ploughing:</strong>&nbsp;Ploughing parallel to the contours of a hill slope to form a natural barrier for water to flow down a slope is called contour ploughing.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Shelter Belts:</strong>&nbsp;Rows of trees that are planted in certain areas to check wind movement are called shelter belts. Contour Barriers. Stones, grass and soil are used to build barriers along contours. Trenches are made in front of the barriers to collect water.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Rock Dams:</strong>&nbsp;This prevents gullies and further soil loss since rocks are piled up to slow down the flow of water.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2.</strong>&nbsp;<strong>What is the threat to vegetation and wildlife? What is the need to conserve them? How can we do this? [V. Imp.]</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Forests and wildlife are an important resource. Climate change and human interferences in the animal kingdom can cause loss of natural habitat for plants and animals. Certain species have become endangered and many have become extinct now. Poaching incidents contribute to their extinction. Plants and animals are an important part of the ecosystem. Plants provide food, oxygen and shelter to humans and animals. Animals provide us important products such as milk, meat, honey, etc. There exists a balance in the environment if we do not disturb the natural number of species living on the earth. A single extinction can affect the ecosystem badly. So animals and plants obviously need to be conserved. The government has introduced national parks, wildlife sanctuaries and biosphere reserves for this purpose. Poaching should be severely dealt with. Indiscriminate killings need to be discouraged. Social awareness must be created about importance of trees, social forestry. Students should be involved in vanamahotsavas at regional and community levels.</p>\n"

                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>SHORT ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. Name and describe briefly methods of extraction.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Mining, drilling and quarrying are methods of extraction. Mining is a process of extraction of taking out minerals from rocks under the earth&rsquo;s surface.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Open cast mining:</strong> In this, minerals lying at shallow depths are taken out by removing the surface layer.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Shaft mining:</strong> In this, deep bores (called shafts) are made to reach mineral deposits lying at large depths.&nbsp;</li>\n\t<li><strong>Drilling:</strong> In this, deep wells are bored to take out minerals.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Quarrying: </strong>It is the process of extraction in which minerals lying veiy close to the surface are extracted just by digging them out.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. Where are minerals found?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Minerals are found in different types of rocks. Metallic minerals are usually found in igneous and metamorphic rocks that form large plateaus. Examples: iron ore is found in north Sweden, copper and nickel in Canada. In igneous and metamorphic rocks in South Africa, iron, nickel, chromites and platinum are found. Non-metallic minerals are found in sedimentary rock formations. Limestone deposits are found in France. Mineral fuels such as coal and petroleum are found in sedimentary strata.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. Describe the mineral distribution in North America.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The mineral deposits in North America are found in three zones: the Canadian region in the north of the Great Lakes, the Appalachian region and the Rocky Mountains in the West. Iron ore, nickel, gold, uranium and copper are mined in the Canadian Shield Region, coal in the Appalachian region. Western Cordilleras have vast deposits of copper, lead, zinc, gold and silver.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. Write common uses of minerals.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Minerals are important in many industries. Minerals used in gems are usually very hard. These are then set in varying styles of jewellery. Iron and copper are metals used in almost everything. Copper is present in everything from coins to pipes and electricity wires. Silicon, obtained from the mineral quartz, is the base of computer industry. Aluminium, obtained from bauxite ore, and its alloys are used in aeroplanes due to their light weight. Aluminium is also used in kitchen cookware.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5. How is hydroelectricity, produced?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Hydroelectricity is produced from the energy possessed by water falling from great heights. River water is stored in dams. When rain water or river water falls from heights, it flows over turbine blades placed at the bottom of the dam. The moving blades are connected to a generator which produces electricity from this energy. This electricity is called hydroelectricity. The water discharged after its production is used for irrigation.</p>\n",

                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>SHORT ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. Write a short note on the types of economic activities. Give examples.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The three types of economic activities are primary, secondary and tertiary.</p>\n\n<ol>\n\t<li><strong>Primary Activities:</strong>&nbsp;Activities which involve direct extraction and production of natural resources are called primary activities. Examples: agriculture, fishing, mining.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Secondary Activities:</strong>&nbsp;Activities which are concerned with the processing of natural resources are called secondary activities. Examples: manufacturing of finished products.</li>\n\t<li><strong>Tertiary Activities:</strong>&nbsp;Activities which fall neither in the primary category nor the secondary category are called tertiary activities. They form a support to primary and secondary activities. Examples: selling goods, advertising and banking.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. Name the inputs and outputs of agriculture in general. Also mention the various operations involved.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The inputs in agriculture are seeds, fertilisers, machinery, labour, etc. The operations involved in agriculture are ploughing, sowing, irrigation, weeding and harvesting. As outputs of the farming activity, a farmer gets crops, wool, dairy products and poultry products.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. Explain shifting cultivation.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Shifting cultivation is a class of primitive subsistence agriculture. In this, a plot of land is cleared by the farmer. This is done by felling the trees and burning them. The ashes are then mixed with soil and crops are grown. After some time, the land is abandoned and the farmer moves to a different place. This type of farming is common in the thickly forested areas of the Amazon basin, tropical Africa, parts of south-east Asia and north-east India. It is also called &ldquo;slash and burn&rdquo; agriculture, because of the process of felling and burning the trees is involved.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. Enlist the climate conditions required for the proper cultivation of rice. Mention the main regions of its production.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Rice is a major food crop&lsquo;in tropical and sub-tropical parts of the world. Its cultivation needs high temperature, high humidity and rainfall. Its growth is best in alluvial clayey soils, since they have water retention capacity. China and India are the leading producers in the world. In favourable climatic conditions, even two to three crops are grown in a year.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5. What do you understand by agricultural development?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Agricultural development refers to efforts made to increase production in farms so as to meet the ever&not;growing demand of the population. The activities that come under this development are increasing the cropped area, growing more crops, improving irrigation, using fertilisers, sowing HYV (high-yielding variety) of seeds and by promoting mechanisation. Mechanisation ensures that little labour is done by the farmers; instead machines are used to provide efficiency.</p>\n",
                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. Describe subsistence farming and its types in detail.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The two main types of farming are: subsistence farming and commercial farming.</p>\n\n<p>Subsistence farming is practised solely to meet the needs of the farmer&rsquo;s family. Therefore, the practices involved are usually old- fashioned. Use of modern technology is minimum and most work is done by household labour.</p>\n\n<p>In intensive, subsistence agriculture, simple tools and huge labour are used by a farmer to cultivate a small plot of land. More than one crop is grown annually in favourable conditions. Rice is the major crop. This form of agriculture is seen in the thickly populated areas of the monsoon regions of south, south-east and east Asia. Shifting cultivation is a class of primitive subsistence agriculture. In this, a plot of land is cleared by felling the trees and burning them. The ashes are then mixed with soil and crops are grown. After some time, the land is abandoned and the farmers move to a different place. This type of farming is common in the thickly forested areas of the Amazon basin, tropical Africa, parts of south-east Asia and north-east India. It is also called &ldquo;slash and burn&rdquo; agriculture.</p>\n\n<p>Nomadic herding refers to the practice in which herdsmen move from place to place with their animals for fodder and water. Animals usually reared are the yak, sheep, camel and goats.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. Describe commercial farming and its types in detail.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Commercial farming is the practice in which crops are grown exclusively for commercial purpose, i.e. for sale in the market. A large area is cultivated and huge capital is involved unlike subsistence farming. Machines are used to a large extent.</p>\n\n<p>Commercial grain farming is a class of commercial farming. Crops like wheat and maize are grown for commercial purpose. The temperate grasslands of North America, Europe and Asia are some common areas where it is seen.</p>\n\n<p>Mixed farming is another type of commercial farming. The land is used for growing food and fodder crops and rearing livestock. Some areas where it is followed are Europe, eastern USA, Argentina, south-east Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. Plantations are a type of commercial farming where only a single crop (like tea, coffee, sugarcane, cashew, rubber, banana or cotton) is grown. Large amount of labour and capital are required. The produce is processed in the farm itself or nearby factories.</p>\n"

                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>SHORT ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. Describe briefly the classification of industries on basis of raw material used.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;On the basis of raw material used, industries are classified into agro, mineral, marine and forest-based. The raw material of agro-based industries consists of plant and animal based products. Some examples are food processing, cotton textile industry and leather industry. The raw material used in mineral- based industries consists of mineral ores. An example: iron and steel industry.<br />\nMarine-based industries use products obtained from the sea and oceans as raw materials. Sea food industry is one such industry.<br />\nA forest-based industry uses forest produce as raw material. Examples are paper industry and furniture.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. Describe briefly the classification of industries on basis of ownership.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;On the basis of ownership, industries are classified into private sector, state owned (public sector), joint sector and cooperative sector. Private sector industries are owned by individuals or a group of individuals. Public sector industries are owned by the government. Joint sector industries are owned and operated by the state and individuals. Maruti Udyog is an example of such an industry. Cooperative sector industries are owned and operated by the producers or-suppliers of raw materials, workers or both. AMUL is one such industry.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. Describe the inputs, processes and outputs in an industrial system with an example.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;An industrial system consists of inputs, processes and outputs. Raw materials, labour, costs, transport, power and infrastructure are inputs. In a cotton textile industry for example, inputs are cotton, human labour, transport cost, etc. Processes are activities done to convert raw material into finished products. In a cotton textile industry, ginning, spinning, weaving, dyeing, etc are processes. The finished product and all profits earned are the outputs. In a cotton textile industry, the outputs are clothes we wear.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. Give examples of industrial regions in India and the world.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The major industrial areas of the world are eastern North America, western and central Europe, eastern Europe and eastern Asia. In India, major industrial regions are Mumbai-Pune cluster, Bangalore-Tamil Nadu region, Hugli region, Ahmedabad-Baroda region, Chhotanagpur industrial belt, Vishakhapatnam-Guntur Belt, Gurgaon-Delhi-Meerut region and the Kollam-Thiruvananthapuram industrial cluster.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 5. Write the properties and significance of steel.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Steel has these properties: it is tough, it can easily be shaped (malleability), cut or made into wire (ductility). Adding certain other elements makes it harder, tougher, and rust-retention capability.<br />\nSteel is the backbone of modern industry. We use a lot of steel objects in daily life. Ships, trains and most other vehicles, tiny needles and safety pins, machinery and equipment, buildings, etc utilise steel as a main or sole constituent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 6. What factors supported Sakchi being chosen to set up the steel plant by TISCO?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Sakchi was chosen for various reasons. It was close to the Kalimati Railway Station. It was also close to iron ore, coal and manganese deposits. Kolkata, a source of large market, was not faraway. Jharia coal fields, and limestone, dolomite, limestone and manganese from Orissa and Chhattisgarh were easily accessible. The nearby rivers (Kharkai and Subamarekha) provided sufficient water supply.</p>\n",
                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>LONG ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. Describe the cotton textile industry with special reference to its history and spread in India.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Cotton is a natural fibre crop. The cotton textile industry is the industry which involves in making clothes out of the fibre. It is one of the oldest industries of the world. India has a glorious history of producing excellent quality cotton textiles.</p>\n\n<p>The Muslins of Dhaka, Chintzes of Masulipatnam, Calicos of Calicut and gold-wrought cotton of Burhanpur, Vadodara and Surat had world-famous quality and design. The traditional Indian cotton textile industry, however, could not compete with the Western textile mills, due to the high cost of the hand woven textile. The process involved, moreover, was time-consuming.</p>\n\n<p>The first successful mechanised textile mill in India was established in Mumbai in 1854. The factors that led to the success were the warm and moist climate, the presence of a nearby port for importing machinery, the availability of raw material and skilled labour. Humidity was a main reason why the industry was initially limited to Maharashtra and Gujarat.</p>\n\n<p>Today the industry has spread to various other parts of the country, due to the artificial production of humidity. The important cotton textile centres are in Coimbatore, Kanpur, Chennai, Ahmedabad, Mumbai, Kolkata, Ludhiana, Puducherry and Panipat.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. Write short notes on (a) iron and steel industry in Pittsburgh and (b) cotton textile industry in Osaka.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:&nbsp;</strong>(a) Pittsburgh is an important steel city in the USA. Most raw materials such as coal are available locally. Iron ore is brought from the iron mines in Minnesota. The shipping of ore is also a convenient pathway: the Great Lakes of North America. From the lakes to the industrial area, trains are there to carry the ore. Rivers like the Ohio, the Monogahela and the Allegheny provide adequate water supply.Finished steel is transported to the market by both land and water routes.</p>\n\n<p>(b) Osaka is an important textile centre in Japan. It is called the &ldquo;Manchester of Japan&rdquo;. Like every important centre, geographical factors played an important role in the establishment of industry here. The plains around Osaka meant land was easily available for growth of cotton mills. Warm and humid climate is well suited to the spinning and weaving of cotton. The river Yodo provides adequate water supply. Easily available labour and location of port are also significant factors. The industry however depends completely on imports. The finished product is exported and is not very expensive.</p>\n"

Fertility of soils, availability of fresh water, minerals are other major geographical factors behind this. Some social factors that boost the density of population in a region are better housing, education and health facilities. Places with cultural or historical significance are usually populated. Employment opportunities are another attraction for large chunks of population.</p>\n\n<p>(iii) The world population has grown veiy rapidly because of the development in medical science which has caused decrease in death rate. Since lesser people die now of diseases than before, whereas there was no way to decrease the birth rate, the population has increased at a fast rate.</p>\n\n<p>(iv) Geographical factors: People prefer to live on plains more than mountains or plateaus and they live more in moderate climates than extreme hot or cold. From the agriculture point of view, fertile lands are preferred. Areas with mineral deposits are more populated.<br />\nEconomic factors: People prefer to industrial areas since they provide more and better employment opportunities. Due to this, industrial cities are thickly populated.</p>\n\n<p>(v) The structure of the population with various respects like age, sex, literacy, occupations, health facilities, economic condition, etc is called population composition.<br />\n(vi) A population pyramid is a pictorial way to describe the population composition. The shape of population pyramid of a country is indicative of a lot of information about the country. The size towards the bottom may be used to estimate the birth rate, while the size towards the top to estimate the death rate.</p>\n\n<p>(vii) A population pyramid in which the base is broad and the top part is narrow means that although a large amount of births take place, not all grow up to be adults and old; it means many die before reaching these ages. This indicates a large death rate and Kenya shows such a pyramid. This means a high population growth rate.<br />\nIn countries like India, the death rate is decreasing, so the pyramid is broad in the younger age groups, and the size of the pyramid decreases steadily.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2.

Factors that influence this include favourable climate; good supplies of natural resources and fertile land.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 4. Activity:</strong><br />\n<strong>Discuss the characteristics of a society with &ldquo;too many under 15s&rdquo; and one with &ldquo;too few under 15s&rdquo;.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The society with too many under 15s need more schools to be able to educate them. There should be efficient and laborious teachers. There should be provisions for items necessary for a child&rsquo;s amusement, like toys. Children are prone to diseases; facilities for hospitals should be improved in such a society.<br />\nIn a society with too few under 15s will have more and more mature people. Pension schemes will work there fruitfully. There may be the need for wheelchairs. Labour supply will be easier. These people will also need hospitals.</p>\n",

                "<p style=\"text-align:center\"><strong>SHORT ANSWER TYPE QUESTIONS</strong></p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 1. Describe how various factors affect population distribution.</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Topography, favourable climate, fertility of soils, availability of fresh water, minerals are major geographical factors affecting population density of a region.<br />\nPeople prefer to live on plains more than mountains or plateaus and they live more in moderate climates than extreme hot or cold. From the agriculture point of view, fertile lands are preferred. Areas with mineral deposits are more populated. Some social factors that boost the density of population in a region are better housing, education and health facilities. Places with cultural or historical significance are usually populated. Employment opportunities are another attraction for large chunks of population.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 2. Describe how the population of the world has grown in history. What has caused the population explosion?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;The world population grew steadily initially. It reached a billion in the year 1820. But the next two billion were added in just a hundred and fifty years. By 1970 the population was 3 billion. In the next 29 years, i.e. by the year 1999, the population had doubled to 6 billion. The population explosion has been mainly caused by the growth in medical facilities, which has decreased the death rate by a large extent.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Question 3. What are the factors affecting the population change in a region? [Imp.]</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;Factors affecting the population change in a region are birth rate, death rate and migrations. Birth rate is a statistic that measures the number of live births per 1000 people. Death rate is a statistic that measures the number of deaths per 1000 people. Along with birth and death rate, another factor affecting population change is migration. Migration refers to the movement of people from one area to another. People leaving a country are called emigrants and the phenomenon is called emigration. People arriving in a country are called immigrants and the phenomenon is called immigration.</p>\n",

A developing country, a developed country, or an underdeveloped country?</strong><br />\n<strong>Answer:</strong>&nbsp;A population pyramid is a pictorial way to describe the population composition. An age-sex pyramid gives information about the distribution of different age groups of people based on gender. The shape of the age-sex pyramid of a country is indicative of a lot of information about the country. The size towards the bottom may be used to estimate the birth rate, while the size towards the top to estimate the death rate.</p>\n\n<p>A population pyramid in which the base is broad and the top part is narrow means that although a large amount of births take place, not all grow up to be adults and old; it means many die before reaching these ages. This indicates a large death rate and Kenya shows such a pyramid. This means a high population growth rate.<br />\nIn countries like India, the death rate is decreasing, so the pyramid is broad in the younger age groups, and the size of the pyramid decreases steadily.</p>\n\n<p>(a) The given population pyramid has a base narrower than some of its upper parts. This means that the birth rate of the country is not too much.</p>\n\n<p>(b) As we go to the top, the shape indicates that more people reach the old age. This shows a lower death rate as well.</p>\n\n<p>(c) This is most likely to be the age-sex pyramid of a developed country. The population growth rate seems to be controlled. Moreover the youth form a major part of the population, so the development levels must be high.</p>\n"
